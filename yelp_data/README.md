# Yelp DataSet Tools

## Description

Tools for working with Yelp data from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge)

## Purpose

We used this corpus for our Annotation for Machine Learning group project. Here's an overview of the purpose of the project:

Yelp's travel reviews help users find highly-rated travel destinations and experiences. However, the rating system could potentially filter out some not-high-enough ranking places that users would be interested in, and users may find difficulties in searching for reviews that contain aspects they care about the most. For instance, a restaurant that lacks of service skills and cleanliness may be rated low by people who care a lot about dining environment, but it can still be a good place for people who only care about the food quality; and if a user is seeking for places where only locals go to, the high ranking reviews on historic and scenic attractions would not help much. 

Therefore, our goal in this project is to create profiles for different types of reviewers based on what reviewers write the most about -- e.g. adventure, relaxation, socializing, cleanliness, and cost. In particular, we focus not on whether reviewers write positive or negative things about those topics, but how much they write about each of those topics. With the profiles, the machine will be able to generate a more precise and personalized recommendation for users.
