She wanted me to tell her what I wanted to do.  Offered ZERO advice or guidance on tax credits, deductions, the process of paying the IRS or receiving a refund.  Dug?  Why am I paying you then?  I know little about taxes, so it felt like the blind leading the blind.  Dont pay this company hundreds of dollars to file your taxes if you expect any guidance.  If you want to pay someone for data entry into Turbo Tax, then by all means, go with them.  Something you could probably do yourself at home for free.  They expect you to know their job.",

Let's face it, from the outside, this firm is very regal and appears to be the end all be all for accounting firms.  The first year the firm did our taxes, it was easy and painless.  The moment I started asking for help or asking questions I would receive, that will cost you $120+ per hour, we don't give info over the phone and I'd get referred to some website to search for an answer.  After paying hundreds of dollars for completed returns, an SCorp filing and a DBA filing and not knowing how to move forward, I called.  Once again, I was told it was a fee to talk to them.  The receptionist Jeanie, along with both Fish brothers, speak down to their customers-they have little to no respect and are completely unwilling to help-even after spending HUNDREDS of dollars for their services.  It's as if they expect you to know how to do their job and get annoyed and frustrated when you don't know tax.  I've NEVER received such horrific service from what appeared to be a reputable company.  I'm at year end, didn't pull a salary, never was explained what needed to happen and I'm needing to have a salary shown NOW.  Well, isn't that great...there goes my income for the rest of the year because the estimates they provided were far from accurate.  I've sought out someone new for my taxes and have since learned that the little I was guided to do was very shady and unethical.",

My name was the next name on the sign-up list, with her back to me, she turned to the other customer seated who happened to be Caucasian, I am African-American, and said. \" I can help you\"'. I spoke up and said \"I'm next\". She said \"are you sure\"  and even the security guard told her \"yes\". \nThe whole time I was seated at her desk, she never looked up at me when speaking to me, and she appeared unhappy that she had to assist me.\nI am TOTALLY insulted, I am an educated (Master's Degree) Woman, not that it should matter and I have never experienced this kind of service at any branch of this Credit Union, EVER!!!!!\nMy father served on the board of directors in the1980's and I have been loyal since I opened my account many years ago.\nBecause of the service I received today, I will have to find another branch to transact \n business at as I will never return to this location again as I may have to encounter this individual again. She, in my opinion, needs a a lesson in customer service. \nThis is discrimination at its best, and today, I am embarrassed to be associated with One Nevada Credit Union and plan to share this experience with those whom I know have accounts at this institution.\nThank you for your time,\nRobyn McGough",

After standing there having to do several transactions (because you'll only accept 50 notes at a time) your machines ALWAYS end up rejecting a handful of notes, meaning I have to end up queuing at the counter anyway (which as a business customer I'm not supposed to do).\n\nHonestly, just sticking all my notes in one envelope and putting it in the deposit slot was so much quicker and easier.\n\nYours frustratedly,\n\nRachel",

I was allowed to apply via phone, told with certainty that the proof of address I had available would be accepted, then made to wait for weeks before actually receiving the necessary information, sending all the things in that I was told would be fine, only to find out that they wouldn't accept the information I provided. This was so inefficient and infuriating, I will never attempt to bank with Santander again. NatWest offers the same interest rates available at Santander, but didn't waste weeks of my life on inaccurate information.

I am not looking for an estimate for I keep records of income myself and know exactly how much I have made and each project I have completed for each company. I am requesting my 1099 misc form that I have always received every year before (before the company I worked for hired them) Having a 1099 misc form sent to me to file taxes is a way to document every single piece of income and makes it easier to report to the IRS.I may not be an expert with taxes or accounting but I know what to expect when this time of year comes. When the company I worked for outsourced to EK Tax & Accounting, I never received my checks on time AND never received my 1099 misc forms for the last 2 years. This has been the first time having to deal with this and I have been a freelancer for the last 8 years. it has become utterly frustrating to deal with this.

When it came to a recent mortgage application, I found BOFA to be average or below average but their competitor who I won't name right now has been superb and dedicated to the customer. \n\nSo, currently I am with the competitor for my mortgage and other loan needs even though I still bank at BOFA.

So I was prepared for lackluster. \n\nI was actually, kind of dreading the process. Anyhow, I met with the first of three candidates: Wanda E. O'Malley. Here's how that went: she absolutely knocked my socks off. I'm actually looking forward to my current CPA's retirement now. Wanda is super approachable. she is an excellent listener who knows how to really be present with the person she is talking to. That alone scores HUGE points in my book. It seems that when most people are in conversation they are thinking about what they want to say next instead of actually engaging and truly listening. SO that tells me that Wanda will be all over the details when it's time to take over our taxes. \n\nAs a local real estate agent, I get plenty of requests for referrals for various professionals, and it will be a pleasure to refer Wanda E. O'Malley at every opportunity. One last thing to note: I did a little digging, and discovered that not only  has Wanda graduated with an accounting degree, she actually graduated as Magna Cum Laude of her class. Pretty impressive. Give it a go with Wanda E. O'Malley CPA when you have accounting needs; I'm sure you will be glad you did.",

So, Bank of America returned our money after about a week but Bank of America has decided to keep $100 dollars for \"legal fees\" and $10 from an overdraft protection fee that cleaned out a savings account when the order was issued. Even the SS agents say this act of seizing death benefits done by Bank of America was illegal in the first place \"but this happens all the time with Bank of America\" they said. \n\nOh, I talked to every manager I could at the Bank of America legal department in California until I reached AJ, who said he was at the top of the legal department. He bluntly said, \"we are keeping your money\".\n\nWell Bank of America, you won your $110 for now but you lost 7 accounts already by us closing our accounts to keep you from doing further illegal things to us. I will continue to recommend that people make other banking arrangements to protect themselves from the predatory ways of the Bank of America legal department.\n\nSincerely, Craig Stellpflug - former Bank of America customer",

They deposit my check ,then realize its post dated so she cancels the deposit and rips up both deposit slips in my face as if I'm doing something against the law. I ask for a manager and she comes over with nothing but attitude! So I walk over to the atm, deposit my check,no problem! I will never go here again.",

    "text": "I am reviewing this specific location because the website lists it as the main office/corporate.  I am so pleased with this bank.  I mainly use the Bullhead City and Fort Mohave locations, but need to talk about the bank's online staff (hence the review for the corporate location).  I just had a 3-day long conversation back and forth with Misty (online rep).  There was a misunderstanding with a bill pay item, so I asked for a refund on the overdraft fees I was charged.  Even though she explained clearly how they were assessed, she still submitted my request for refund to the higher powers.  I just checked today and the fees were refunded!  I'm so happy I closed my B of A account and switched to these guys.  Its been almost a year since opening my NBAZ account and life is good.  These guys provide real personal service.  My emails are always answered promptly and clearly.  Although Misty explained that in my situation I would probably not get refunded, she still submitted my request.\nOk, so the situation was that I sent an e-check somewhere.  Normally, when I send an e-check, the funds are taken from my account when the check is \"mailed out\" (which may or may not be an electronic mailing).  For whatever reason, this particular vendor has a different process, so when I send the e-check to them, the funds are not debited until they \"cash the check\" on their end.  (I suppose that means confirm receipt).  So, I had bought something the afternoon before of my automatic deposit because I saw a positive balance and failed to check the actual register.  I had assumed the check cleared already, then went ahead and swiped my card at the store.  Sure enough, the next day I had overdraft fees.  Apparently the check cleared at some point the day before, but after I had looked at my balance.  \nMy fault for assuming the check cleared.  I just assumed it had processed the same way all my previous online payments had.  It varies vendor to vendor, and not 100% under the bank's control.  I understand now, thanks to Misty's time.  I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone who asked.  \nOne of the appealing things that originally brought me here was their low direct deposit requirement to waive bank fees.  Only $100 monthly as opposed to $250 that B of A asked.  And if I remember correctly, the $250 B of A was asking for was all in one deposit.  It was not a cumulative number that NBAZ uses.  When you work in retail, and hours can get cut in the blink of an eye, this matters.  If it isn't obvious that I believe their online service is phenomenal (although I see opposing opinions), I need to state that I also appreciate their google play app and never had any bugs or glitches with it.",

They took the time to carefully review the items on my credit report I provided them via Score Sense and were very helpful and communicated well throughout the process. The first thing they had me do was request another credit report from a more reliable site that they exclusively use called Privacy Guard. The credit reports were similar but the scores themselves were vastly different! They offered to still try and remove a few items from my credit report but actually suggested that NOT using their services might be a better decision due to the fact that A) my score was actually quite good after attaining it from a more credible site and B) often times when items are attempted to be removed from your report, it could possibly reopen an outstanding item and hurt your score again. \n\nI greatly appreciated this type of honesty and would not hesitate in recommending them for your credit repair needs. One final note - do NOT use the site Score Sense to obtain a credit report and score. It's better to go straight to Go Clean Credit where they not only set you up with a more accurate site, but they can also provide you with a secured credit card to try and improve your score even more.",

Adam did go out of his way to put the deal together, what's sad is i really love this car. it's what happened after the sale is what is going on, if they refund me my money or do more then just hang up i would not be changing my first review, The car fax report shows a car that was destroyed and i can't sell it being a good Christian. It runs, but over heats with in a few miles and the wiring harness is fried and i spent $107.87 for a new battery along with the new floor mats, seat covers oil change. The car books for $5500.00 if in good shape, i got the car for $2500.00 out the door, it was day 14 that the car was no longer driveable and the car won't pass state smog so, this is what put's this deal upside down. i would run a car fax report on ANY used car before you buy from ANYONE. \n\nCome on, return my money or get me into another car. I have sent friend from my church to buy from them so, this tells you their nice, even for used car dealers selling on Car Fax.com are selling worse it's what it is, excuse the pun, USED CAR SALESMEN!

Well, if you take your kid to this particular bank, the kid won't have time to scream; there's literally no lines. Ever.\n\nThat's what I like about this bank - they have their stuff together and whip people in and out in a quick minute. I doubt I've ever been in there longer than 15 minutes, except the time I opened the account. It helps that it's relatively close to my house.\n\nThe tellers are friendly and actually remember what I do for my paychecks. It's a bit weird when there's actual customer service (aka, they remember who you are) because, well, there's not a lot of that these days.\n\nThis isn't an ING account so you're going to get basically nothing in interest, but the account works fine for checking. I love that I had the option to NOT have over drafting (it will just automatically decline the transaction) which I don't think I was ever asked when I used to bank with Washington Mutual/Chase. I've never spent so low that I'm in fear of over drafting, but I think it's a really great feature that they offer and I like that I opted to have my transaction automatically decline should that happen. \n\nI'm happy with the bank, the only thing I really dislike is that I signed up to not get statements in the mail to save on paper, and I still get loan, credit card and air line mile ads from them - defeating the point of saving paper. \n\nOverall, I like US Bank and will stay with them for checking, and put savings into silver (aka, not into a bank account.)",

When I was in the branch earlier this week the manager, John Killman told me about it, and when I informed him I probably had a truck load he told me to come on, so I did this morning and was welcomed with open arms quite literally since he and several other bank employees were on hand to assist.  This is not the first time BB&T has reached out to my business, they did about 18 months ago when Janet Graham, their commercial loan offiicer called upon us offering unbelievable mortgage rates for refinancing our two notes.  Yes, it's true what they say, you can tell they want your business!  Way to go BB&T.",

I was fortunate enough to have Mark personally assist me and go over my policy's and coverage with me.  I have found that Mark's office staff is more than helpful, knowledgable and friendly. I highly recomend if you are new to the Las Vegas community you should contact Mark, Sheila, Rene or Jodi.

Especially when you see some of the people flogging their wares then promptly crossing the street with the winnings to spend it in The Grapes, the embodiment of vice.\n\nApart from this, Cash Converters has an alright stock. They've got loads of TVs, DVD players and Hi-Fis as well as loads of CDs and DVDs. This selection is a little more random, as they come and go every day, so you have no guarantee of finding a good one. A good time to go is the morning when they have a better selection, in the afternoon most of the good ones have gone. It's also ridiculously cheap, with films costing about \u00a31.50 or \u00a32 and a 2 for 1 offer on, so you can get films for about a quid, which isn't bad in my book.",

I let her know to call me back in a week or so and I could try to pay it.  When she called back, my paycheck wasn't as big as I expected so I had no money to offer her.  I didn't answer that day, then the next day she would call 2-3 times a day until finally today (9 days later) I finally answered to tell her I don't have anything to offer.  She said \"Well why did you tell me you could pay it then!?!?\"  I said \"Because at the time I thought I could\"  She said \"This is $45 dollars, you tellin me you don't have $45 dollars?!?!\"  I said \"Yes that is what I am telling you, I don't appreciate the way you are talking to me may I speak to your manager?\"  She said \"My manager??  I'm not putting the manager on the phone for $45 dollars!!!\"  I said \"I don't want to talk to him about the money, I want to talk to him about the way you are treating me\".  She said \"If you can't pay it now, when do you get paid next???\"  I said \"I would rather not share that information incase I am put in a position where I can not pay it again\"   She said \"That is a bunch of BS!!!\"  I said \"Well i'm sorry, things come up\"  She said \"Things come up????  THATS REAL ORIGINAL!!!\"  - Then hung up on me.  Who hired this moron?  Sorry I have $10 dollars in my bank account for food and gas until my next paycheck.",

The customer service people are extremely friendly and will work with you in order to ensure that your financial needs are met.

I'm always completely disorganised and massively last minute about everything, so for me this place is great for a speedy Euros pick up, not that you get many of them to the pound these days. Wow, I hadn't realised I was in such a grumbling mood before I started writing this.\n\nI'm not great at researching and going round places checking lots of different exchange rates, but apparently word on the street is that No.1 Currency, Marks & Spencer, and American Express have the most competitive exchange rates in the city centre, so if you're actually organised about your holidays, unlike me, it's probably worth going round these three and seeing what rates they're offering.",

The teller immediately and rudely demanded that I present proof of my marriage (I had just gotten married and this documentation was not available). She presented a handout on FINTRAC rules against money laundering, which said that for large cash transactions a report had to be filed to the government to report a large deposit. I quickly skimmed this, not noticing that it did not say anything about providing back-up documentation, and suggested that I could deposit a lesser amount but she refused to do this because she \"already knew how much I came in with\". I also suggested that perhaps the cash amount was under 10k and could she please count this? She refused. This left me no choice but to leave the bank and go about my day carrying around 10k cash on me, which was extremely unsafe.\n\nLater that day, I went to another HSBC branch to deposit a smaller amount after keeping the bulk of the cash safely at my home, due to what had happened earlier. The teller there told me that all the first teller had to do was to file a report with the government reporting that a large cash deposit had been made into my account (FINTRAC rules: http://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/msb-esm/reports-declarations/types-eng.asp). Why did the first teller not do this?? There were NO RULES that said that I had to provide proof of my marriage as part of the report. Even if I had some sort of paperwork that proved that I just got married, would this had proved where the money came from? No - this request was completely irrelevant because the cash were gifts from my guests and not traceable.\n\nNot only did the teller at this Yorkville branch not know the rules but she treated me like a money launderer and forced me to continue with my day carrying a huge amount of cash. \n\nTo make things worse, I called in and complained to HSBC about this incident. They apologized and felt that this should not have happened, that the teller should have just filled in the unusual transactions form and filed a report, and said that they would forward my complaint to the HSBC branch manager who would call me to apologize. A month has passed and I have heard nothing. I called in again on another matter and asked about it - they said that the manager would call me, and still, I have heard nothing.\n\nI closed my account yesterday and I want this branch to know that it was their doing. Shame on this horrible teller, and worse, irresponsible management that will not acknowledge the mistakes that their staff are making.",

As a long time resident in the area I can see what has gone wrong here. The Neighborhood has changed a lot in the past 10 years and the mentality at this branch hasn't changed at all. Leslieville being one of the most progressive neighborhoods in the city should have a better banking experience than what is being offered here.\n\nI would also like to take a second to remind you that TD Bank register all there mortgages as a collateral charge.  If you think this is good for you than you have not done your homework. They don't tell you they do this or what it means. When your mortgage comes up for renewal, get as far away as you can from TD.",

    "text": "We shopped around for a loan for our first home and took recommendations for Steve Schauer's office from a friend and our realtor.  \n\nSteve was my very first stop for shopping my loan and he initially spoke with me over the phone.  He suggested that we set up an appointment to meet and go over our loan options.  My husband and I had so many questions as first time home buyers and Steve was so professional and patient with us.  He is an excellent educator, telling us what we needed to know about home mortgages, not overwhelming us with those big scary mortgage terms and explaining everything in as much detail as we needed without going overboard.  He spent so much time with us in his office and we felt totally comfortable asking all of our questions.  \n\nWe initially opted to purchase a new home and had to go with the builder's lender to receive closing costs.  That lender was awful to work with as a first time buyer (totally different review) and we even called Steve a couple of times throughout that process to have him clarify some things for us.  He graciously helped us despite not being our lender at the time. \n\nFast forward a couple of months and we decided the new home wasn't for us.  We found a resale and quickly went back to Steve's office to help us with our mortgage needs.  He and his team worked at LIGHTNING speed to help get a mortgage in place and we closed within 3 weeks.  They kept us updated during every part of the process, were always available to assist us with questions/concerns, and never left us guessing at any point.  \n\nFirst time home buying was such a fun/exhausting/confusing/emotional/stressful experience but I can honestly say dealing with our lender was the EASIEST part of the process thanks to WJB and the Schauer lending team.  I want to thank them for hustling and working so quickly.  We so appreciate all of their hard work and will recommend them a million times over.\n\n***Edited because the Steve I worked with for my mortgage was Steve Schauer and not Steve Lee. Steve Schauer is now at New American Funding on Paseo Verde & Stephanie in Henderson.***",

I got in touch with Steve and from our first conversation over the phone I felt comfortable with him and decided I would give him a shot. He did not disappoint. He is excellent at communication. He told me what he could do and what he could not do and even clued me in on some facts with the loan process that I was not aware of. \n\nI told him I was in a bit of a crunch to get the loan process worked out as soon as possible and he and his team went to work fast. If he had any questions at all he did not hesitate to call or email me. And likewise when I had any questions (and I had a lot) he was very quick at responding back and making me feel at ease with the entire process. \n\nWhen I closed on my home and went to sign my final loan documents Steve was just arriving at the airport from being out of town. He made it a point to rush from the airport to the loan document signing even though it wasn't necessary for him to be there. He just wanted to make sure he would be there to support his client (me) if I had any questions. \n\nI could not recommend Steve and his team more. He was efficient, honest and very quick to respond. All things I appreciate much. I will use Steve again if I ever buy another home and will certainly refer my friends and family to him as well.",

As soon as I signed up, I paid the initiation fee. However, the first bill I received was $50 more than I was told without any explanation. So I gave them a call. This time I spoke to Steve and was told that it was a one time fee for an accident I had 2 and a half years ago. Okay, fine I'll pay that and expect my monthly bill to return to the $140 a month. A couple weeks later a friend told me about  a bundle discount if I were to switch my other car over from Allstate. So again, I called Steve and we added the car but I never received a discount.. \n\nAfter about a month goes by I get my next statement which was normal. Yet, I had received a letter in the mail from my loan providers saying that my insurance had been cancelled. Where did this come from? Assuming this was a misunderstanding, I again called Steve and asked about the letter. At first he brushed me off like it was an invalid letter because it was \"old\" (2 weeks) and that everything was fine. Me, assuming that he didn't even pull my file up, continued to ask more detail specific questions. As soon as I did, he was forced to open my file and sure enough, found something and immediately put me on hold. He ended up having to call me back saying that my insurance, in fact, WAS getting cancelled because of my accident 2 and a half years ago with my CAR. First of all, where was this communication??? What would have happened had I not called him. Aren't you my Insurance provider? Isn't it YOUR JOB to be aware of these things and keep me up to date on what is going on? Second, I initially signed up my truck first and paid the \"1 time fee of $50 to cover my accident\". But the funny thing is, they want to cancel my Truck insurance (which has never been in an accident EVER) and keep my car insurance (which I had just switched over AND got in the accident with). How does this even make sense? \n\nTo top it all off, the customer service I had received by Steve was incredibly dissatisfying. He does not give a crap about you or your policy. All he wants is your money; and fast. In addition, the lack of communication between him and his customers is non existent and he will not remember changes made on your policies. Finally, I never ONCE received an apology nor letter informing me of the changes about to be made. \n\nIf you want my honest opinion, AVOID THIS AGENCY AT ALL COSTS!!  There are far better, more caring insurance agencies out there.",

They have been excellent to work with and made the process so simple I really don't even remember much about my experience with them last year! \n\nI can say this since we filed an extension and just had them wrap up our taxes before the Sept. 15th deadline. They have a great location in a nice building. I'm always greeted by a friendly smile every time I'm there. I was able to email them all of our quickbooks data so my only trip in was to sign the paperwork and pick up my copies. \n\nThey also give you a nicely bound copy to keep for your records and everything is nicely organized with copies of necessary paperwork for each of my 2 other business partners. \n\nI primarily worked with Jennifer over there the last 2 years and I will say she went above and beyond to handle a confusion that occurred this year. \n\nI don't have much experience working with anyone else since this is the only company I've used to file taxes but their prices seem more than reasonable and I haven't heard anything from the IRS saying we owe a lot or there were errors so their work must be good! \n\nI'm working on starting up another LLC so maybe next year I'll have them file for 3 businesses.

She charged JMC several and multiple times for one hour of work when many of the TPT filings required zero tax liability.  I learned after the fact that the form required at most 10-15 minutes of work but she billed for a full hour several times over totaling several hundreds of dollars in unethical billing practices.

This bank location lost my cash credit card payment. I went inside the branch and tried to straighten out the situation. Some young male worker was completely disrespectful to me and treated me like I was a criminal or a scam artist. This teller jumped down my throat and pretty much called me a liar. He didn't even attempt to investigate my complaint. He asked me what the teller looked like who took my payment and I described her. He said no teller looked like that. I walked away because I didn't have a receipt.\n\n1) I used to work as a teller and deposits were lost while I worked at Wells Fargo. It is not unheard of for money to be credited to the wrong account or just lost in general. It didn't happen every day at the bank, but it happened frequently. Again, I worked there for almost 3 years and I saw it happen often enough. \n\n2) I actually used to work at this same branch and was able to identify an employee, a lady named Pat, who was still working there 15 years later.I could not believe that I was treated so disrespectfully and this guy who was supposed to be a supervisor pretty much yelled in my face. He should have investigated it. I didn't have a receipt, so I walked away. I will never make a cash payment again. I knew the date of the transaction and the lazy employee should have been able to investigate it from there.\n\nI am still a Wells Fargo customer only because of a business rep that I deal with in a paradise valley branch. But I will never return to this crappy location. \n\nIf a transaction is lost or not credited to your account, I would call the main 1800# and have them contact the branch to correct mistake or research problem. That way they are forced to investigate the transaction.",

LOST THE CHEQUE!!!!!  if i had ever wanted to punch someone through the phone this was the moment.\n\ntrying to keep the sheer rage and annoyance out of my voice i asked what my options were.  he said they had a copy of the cheque which they could pay out on but this would take another 6-8 weeks.  it had already been 6 weeks since i originally deposited the cheque.  my other option was to get a new cheque and deposit this into my current account. and after speaking with my parents they decided the best option was to get a new cheque and cancel the other one.\n\nso eventually with the new cheque in hand i went to the bank and deposited it.  i was helped by the original guy who had been dealing with the situation.  he assured me that the cheque would show up in my account in 14 days after going through the international holdings to decide the exchange rate.  true to his word, the money did appear and i was finally able to transfer it over to my ISA.\n\nhowever, besides that one helpful guy, the rest of the customer service experience was appalling.  the girl had clearly known that they had lost my cheque but not phoned me to tell me.  and they LOST MY CHEQUE!!!  i can't even begin to describe how unprofessional that is.  i was absolutely shocked that a bank who deals with billions of pounds a day could lost my cheque.  so for that one instance this place gets three stars.",

    "text": "I have maintained an account with Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) for many years. \n\nA few times I have had serious issues with unknowns accessing my checking account and once with a cash deposit \"disappearing\".\n\nThis review will cover the times unknowns accessed my checking account because those are the times no branch activity was involved/my interaction was solely with customer service.\n\nOnce a few years ago my checking account was accessed and several payments were made to a business or businesses unknown by me for I-have-no-idea-what.\n\nTo their credit, the bank called me. I didn't answer but returned their call when I got the message the next day. The customer service rep who helped me was extremely courteous and went out of her way to assure me that all funds would be returned to me, etc.\n\nI did have to fill out a little paperwork but my funds were returned right away.\n\nThis instance resulted in a few overdraft items a few days later but the second customer service rep I spoke with returned those fees to my account during our conversation.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nThe second incidence of unknowns accessing my checking account was early 2011. I once again received a call from the bank. Several payments were said to have been made to a company that teaches ESL and one to a company that sold audio books. The total was almost $300.\n\nI was livid.\n\nThe customer service rep who assisted me was an angel. I know she could hear how I was barely restraining my anger and she assured me that all would be well. Curious, I asked her how someone had gotten into my account. \n\nShe said it looked like someone had most likely accessed my debit card and not my actual bank account. So no need to close my account because the bank would unlink the offending card and issue me a new one which should resolve the issue.\n\n(Which didn't really make me feel any safer because I've had friends who have had similar happen to them again and again and AGAIN, even after being issued new debit cards numerous times.)\n\nAny whooo, I got my new debit card and life continued as usual.\n\nAfter this incident,  I set up banking alerts. Now I get notifications when all sorts of activities occur with my accounts.",

    "text": "We insured with Traci at Sed Poche's State Farm office and for the first term it was okay. Then, in the renewal, my son dropped off the insurance. He had been in their system for the first term, but inexplicably disappeared - the renewal cards and papers included only me, my husband and daughter. I called the office, but, of course, it was closed, so I got the call center who said, \"That's strange\" more times than you ever want to hear. For some unknown reason, my son wasn't on the renewal policy. But, they said, he's listed as in the household, so he's covered. I got nothing in the mail to confirm any of that. A couple of weeks later, my son bought a car, so I called Sed's office and told them that same day. They worked on that for me and came back with an increase of $20 a month for my son's car. I asked them, so he's insured right now? \"Yes,\" they said. \"He's good to go.\" My son goes to the DMV on a Saturday to register the car and they say we need evidence of your insurance, have them fax it over. I called, and of course, got the call center (because nobody has insurance issues on a Saturday and never needs anyone to be in the local office who are making money on your policy...) anyway, the call center said..... not only was my son NOT on the policy, neither was his car, and there was NO record of either phone call that I'd made, one to find out why he was left off, and two, to add the new car. So my son is at the DMV, in the line, getting closer to the front and I'm having to go all over my son's details and the car details AGAIN so this guy in the call center can add him. AND, he's been driving this car for two weeks and he wasn't insured!! This is a staggering lack of decent process and customer care that left us vulnerable and with no cover for my son or anyone he might have hit. So guess who's looking for a new insurance company now? ............................... Update!!! So the initial agent we spoke to this morning, who categorically told me he had faxed the form to the DMV, did not! So yet another long call to another State Farm agent and then a three way call with the DMV to get my son on his way. He was at the DMV at 7:30 and he's just got done at noon. Just the most appalling customer service of any company I've ever dealt with - ever. On this one, I'd give minus five stars if I could........................... Final Update - they sent my renewal and my monthly bill DOUBLED. From $355 to $669. Needless to say, we're back with Geico.",

    "text": "Received another unsolicited telemarketing call from this company today.  They have been making their unprofessional sales calls for many years now, and the reverse lookup of their phone number is indicative of their ongoing attempts to badger the good people of Phoenix.  Their newest addition of \"mortgage protection\" is another B-grade product with little benefit to homeowners according to my review.\n\nThe folks at Design Benefits seem to not be getting the message about the Do Not Call list, and I, for one, find it frustrating they continue to be a black mark on the insurance industry here in Arizona because of their tactics.  I have to wonder if they are still part of Southwest Resources (Bob Harden's group) that also used to pull the exact same diabolical tricks, as these two companies were once aligned.\n\nTypical behavior in a call from them is to not reply once you've answered (like a robodialer would do), breathe heavily or mumble, pitch health insurance if you're the business owner, or ask for the names of people in the company in an attempt to solicit again by phone or mail.  Reporting them to the Arizona Department of Insurance seems to have no effect.\n\nIf you happen to receive an unsolicited call from them (480-612-0250), I recommend you follow these steps:\n\n1.  Ensure your employer or company doesn't use them for their benefits management.  If they do, then Design Benefits can call you UNTIL you ask them to stop.\n\n2.  If you are certain you're not utilizing their services in any way when they call, demand that you be removed from their list and that they confirm it has been done.  Register your telephone number under the DoNotCall.gov website if you haven't already done so.\n\n3.  If they call again, remind them you're on the DNC list (if you're on it) and/or have requested they stop calling.  Further calls subject them to fines or other disciplinary action.\n\nYou are allowed to file a legal claim against them if they continue from that point. Search the web on how to do so.\n\nIf you're seeking insurance of any kind, I recommend going somewhere else.",

I reached out to her each time and she told me I had all the qualifying discounts. In December 2015, I purchased a new car. Brittny initially quoted me for a $15 increase each month, but after providing VIN number, etc. my policy went up almost $30! I emailed her several times and she basically told me there's nothing she could do to lower my monthly cost unless I signed up for life insurance. I got insurance quotes from 5 other companies.....FIVE! And guess what? All 5 agents told me she was over insuring me and \"ripping me off.\" So now that my car insurance is only $90 a month (you do the math! $40 in savings each month X 12 is $480 plus the home owners savings) and my home owners insurance went down $350 a year, I realized that Brittny at Allstate really got me these last couple years and that really irks my nerves. I give her 3 stars because she was always very nice...up until I emailed her to give her the chance to review my policy before switching companies...then she just stopped replying to my emails and they were very short over the phone when I called in.

But we love each other and we want to have enough money one day to buy some land and love each other far, far away from other people.  So, after a few months of balking at the idea of going to a bank, where they do bad things like ask me for money every damn month and charge me for the privilege of keeping my meager amount of cash in their greedy, clutching hands, I gave up.  We put on our least-ratty pairs of Chucks and wandered over to Wells Fargo to talk with someone about what a mortgage actually is and if we'll ever qualify for one.\n\nThank the sweet baby jesus we got Shondra.  Wonderful, knowledgeable, kind, incredibly helpful and patient and funny and did I mention kind already Shondra.  She took a full two hours walking us through extremely basic concepts and showing us how we could track our savings progress through the WF website... and then, just when she thought she was done with us, Boyfriend remembered he'd been having weird transactions for, um, the past fifteen months on his monthly statements (like I said, we're money idiots).  So Shondra, without batting an eye, took care of them.  All six of them.  She got a cool $200 back into his account immediately, then gave him an internal WF number so that he could track his statements even further back in time and get that cash back, too.  \n\nI should also mention that through all of these shenanigans, Shondra maintained the perfect blend of professionalism and understanding.  When she wasn't helping us deal with money issues, she animated recounted stories of Flagstaff, the Four Corners, and living off the land- issues very near and dear to my hippie-dippie little heart.  Boyfriend and I left Wells Fargo calm, happy and with the knowledge and understanding to start saving up for our dream cabin.  Which, incidentally, is in the Four Corners.  Thank you Shondra, I actually can't wait to go back!",

He has a fantastic team that ensures no mistakes are made and therefore, no surprises at the closing table. Our loan was a bit tricky for a number of reasons but Phil suggested a perfect fit for our budget & needs and then followed through with the underwriting staff to make sure that what he promised- he delivered. In our case, our Realtor was on vacation so he made it a point to be there with us at signing to ensure all documentation was accurate. If you are looking for the best, look no further.",

And I don't like spending what little time I do have waiting at the bank. \n\nThankfully there is this lovely branch right across the street from my building. No need to park. No need to come in during busy times. I come in mid morning and am helped right away. I mean five minutes in and out. Normally I would be disappointed but it's okay when we're talking about banks. ;) \n\nThe staff is always super friendly and always complimentary. It's not like I am going to close my account if they didn't like my hair or earrings but its always nice to have a bit of conversation with the staff while my transactions are processing. \n\nAnyways, banking here has always been a joy.

    "text": "If i could give negative 5 stars, I would.\n\nHere's what I experienced in a year and a half with this \"bank\":\n\n- They dinged my credit score when I opened my account, not once, but twice. How, you ask? The initial \"credit union\" check, and then I declined to apply for their credit card, yet a week later got a \"pre-approval\" in the mail, which I ignored, and when I checked my credit there was an inquiry for \"applying for the card\". What?!\n\n- On attempting to cash in some savings bonds, the teller took 20 minutes (!!!) and nearly deposited it in the wrong account. It was lucky she tried to address me as \"Stephanie\" or else somebody else would have gotten my money. How exactly do you screw that up when you have both my debit card and drivers license there?\n\nStone-age technology:\n- Their website is ALWAYS down. My God. At least 3x a week.\n- Their email does not work. I tried to close my accounts (and I refuse to do it in person or online, because I don't want to listen to their spiel to get me to keep it open) and the email bounced back. Professional, eh?\n- You can't do ANYTHING over the phone, so when the website is down, either drive to a branch or you're screwed. I was in Vegas, away from a computer, and had to call and give my login info to a friend to transfer money to my checking account. This is ridiculous.\n\nAnd the piece de resistance, the re-arranging of transactions. I log in one day, expecting to have one NSF fee from an emergency purchase, and see my account is negative nearly $300. WHAT?  \nThese bastards had 1) hit me with an NSF fee when I was $61 positive, then 2) re-arranged several days worth of transactions so the largest hit first, causing another NSF fee (which only happened because of the missing $35 from their first false NSF fee!), and then the whole thing just cascaded into oblivion. \n\nI am so beyond pissed at Desert Schools. I refuse to deal with them anymore. These s***heads can keep calling/mailing every day, turn me into collections, whatever, but I just walked away and am not paying for any of their bullshit charges.\n\nI switched over to Wells Fargo (who does NOT rearrange transactions, and all pending transactions show up immediately online) and am much happier.",

After speaking with Jennifer Craft and her Manager named Ayesha at this branch, I decided to move my accounts to US Bank. There are two reasons why I am abandoning my current banking relationship of 14 years: \n\n1) \"Too Big To Fail\" means \"Too Big To Compete\"\n     My old bank is a huge bureaucracy of left hands not talking to right hands, intentional and willful slowness to benefit no one, and an employee culture of elitism. \n2) The three rules of banking never applied: Convenience, Cost, and Care.\n    My old bank, although with tons of branches spread out everywhere, was never convenient. The costs associated with the accounts were exorbitant and they raised my credit card interest rate to 38% \"just because\". And nobody new my name after years of banking at the same branch. WTH? Could you \"pretend\" to care?\n\nAt US Bank (particularly this branch), Jennifer Craft took the time to get to know me and what products and services could be beneficial to me. Jennifer Craft went the extra \"mile and a half\" (while Ayesha fielded all the other customers waiting in line) to make sure I had everything I needed. If patience is a virtue and knowledge is power, Jennifer Craft is both virtuous and powerful.\n\nBig plus for US Bank: Current and former United States military service members receive \"Platinum Checking\" at no charge.\n\nBig pluses for this branch: Care with a capital \"C\". Open seven days a week. Get it? A bank open on Sunday! Convenient location.\n\nBig negative for (Gank of America): A mortgage department not motivated to do real work means the last straw on an overly burdened camel.

If your money is in a bank, you're really missing out on the credit union MEMBERSHIP experience.",

I was in Florida at the time on a long term assignment, hundreds of miles from a Keybank.  I discovered the fraudulent charges when I checked my balance just before leaving on a road trip.  I called the customer service number and within a few hours all my money was back in my account.  They canceled my number and sent me an all new card by FedEx which arrived the next day at my destination. They made the whole recovery process so easy.  Miss this bank, big time.",

    "text": "Once upon a time Keybank was great, but over the past two years or so I've been pretty disappointed with Keybank.  I would suggest finding another bank.\n\nSome disappointments about my experience with Keybank: (1) Their customer service phone number is only open 8 hrs/day, 5 days/week.  (2) They play silly games with their savings accounts, where after half a year or so they significantly lower the interest rate with no warning, while creating some other brand of savings account with a significantly better interest rate for new customers.  (So they care more about attracting new customers than about treating loyal customers well.)  (3) They make money off of fees, so be pretty careful about that.  (4) Keybank doesn't support ACH transfers unless you have online banking.  (5) Keybank handle renewals of CDs in an annoying way.  If you want to renew your CD, you have to call up in this narrow window right when or shortly after it expires and ask them to do so.  If you call up several weeks in advance -- say, because you're going to be travelling -- to try to set up how the CD will be handled when it reaches its maturation date, they will ignore you and tell you to call back.  If you can't conveniently call back in that short time window, sorry, sucks to be you; they don't care.",

They say that banking can be comfortable (have you gone through the mortgage process?!?) and that they're voted #1 customer service for years. Is that true?  Actually, to some degree it is.  There's 3 TD banks conveniently close to my work and with how they're run, you'd think they actually did their homework to figure out clientele volume!\n\nThis bank in particular is well staffed at the teller counter.  I usually see at least 3 working constantly during lunch and I've even seen them pull another person in for 4 active stations when it gets a bit busy.  The line ups are never longer than 2 people.  The ATMs are my choice ... it's fast and I'm on there to get cash on the odd occasion.  I've never had to line up as there is more than one here and most people these days know how to use an ATM thankfully.\n\nThe Financial Service Reps are all helpful and they're willing to answer questions.  It's really to book an appointment here if you want to discuss something.  There are varying degrees of expertise so make sure you specifiy what you want done ahead of time!  Not all of them can do stocks, mutual funds, or big mortgage applications.  \n\nI've never had an issue with this particular bank and everyone is always pleasant.  So maybe banking can be this comfortable?",

    "text": "Overall, Wells Fargo is a solid bank. This review is meant to illustrate this specific bank location's accountability, which I found to be excellent. \n\n Today (10 Dec), I came in ready to give some aggressive feedback to this bank after being $5 negative in my bank account earlier this week. The banker (through bank-teller Nadia) told me that if I make a $10 deposit to cover the  -$5 I would not be charged overdraft. \n\n I didn't believe it. Far too many experiences have shown me I would have to cover the $12.5 overdraft protection fee so it doesn't turn into an additional $35 overdraft fee. I asked for it in writing and he said to just come back if I'm charged and he will reverse it. The next day when I was charged the overdraft fee, a banker closer to my area of town told me there was 0% possibility management would reverse the fee. At this point I'm thinking the man who gave me his word had cost me $35. \n\n Today, I stopped by the branch and talked to Nadia again and the manager learned the situation. She immediately reversed the fee because the banker had given me his word. This is great news, and I'm happier to be with this bank because this branch honored their word.",

He tried to make the car/home payments on the same day but I said so I am paying extra days for nothing? he said yeah we can do that and kind of smirked about it. So of course I made it different days money ain't easy and that was very weird. Other than that he also made some similar odd comments that I don't recall since it's been awhile.\n\nAfter year 1 I didn't get the new insurance card in the mail, I actually found out 2,3 months later so I was carrying expired policy. And they didn't mail me the new card for 2,3 months(until I saw my expired card in my wallet). I went online and requested the new card, after 5 business days I still didn't get it and also got a voice mail from a lady asking if I got the card. So I ask for the card again and got it like 7 business days later. 7.\n\nTried to email and ask question on the statefarm site but they didn't' know who I am, I logged on I would think it will have my info when emailing (not secure message) but I guess not and it's the website's crappy design.(but they can look me up using the email) \n\nEmailed Eric James to see how do I cancel the policies, he said just tell him over the email. 5 Days later I still got charged, called and Eric wasn't there, Vanessa answered and said if I want to cancel I HAVE to do it by phone, and they need a date. In the email with Eric I said cancel it until end of this billing cycle since I already paid, just don't renew it he said fine. But on the phone it's a total different story I have to cancel by phone and they need an exact date. You see how much difficulties and headache that I had with them? and I never filed a claim, can't believe how difficult it would be to file a claim so I switched insurance of course.\n\nTried to look up a complaint line on statefarm site but can't find it, did a comment/suggestion thing for all of above. wonder if they even read it anyways if I can rate 0 star I would, definitely won't recommend them.\n\nupdate: Nov 9th I emailed Eric to cancel and not renew my policies and he acknowledged in email. Nov 17th I still got charged for a new month, next day I called Vanessa for a refund and still didn't get it as of today Dec 3rd. Also another policy was charged for a new month on Dec 1st. It's just problems after problems.",

We were with State Farm in our previous state as well. We have never had a car accident, speeding ticket or home problem and we always pay our bills. But as of a week ago my shower tiles started bulging out of the wall, never seen that before so I called a bathroom remodel place and figured it's time to remodel bathroom. Home was built in 1997. They came and inspected and said a pipe was broken behind the wall causing this to happen which may mean mold as well and it's draining under the tub as well. Very costly. So they said call your home insurance and this is something they should fix. We called and State Farm sent out a man who told us no they won't help us only if there was water spraying everywhere! And this may have been going on for awhile and they only handle things right when it happens. Please tell me how I was supposed to know a pipe was broken behind a wall? Do I have my ear against the wall when I shower? Why would I even think that? When I saw tiles bulging (which as of today have fallen out of the wall see photo) i called immediately for fear of getting water in the cracks. This is unacceptable and I am just shocked. Years of paying and no help from State Farm or Eric James. He even refused to take our call or even call us back. It's is just me and my old mom and we now have to live in this moldy smell thanks to no help from State Farm. Never use this company or Eric James. They have disappointed us and now we will cancel our policies and go elsewhere to people who care.",

My old insurance company USAA dropped me after getting one too many speeding tickets and sent me packing to Progressive. At first I was offended and a little hurt but that was the best thing that has happened. They are GREAT... The customer service the claims reps everything. They care and act like they mean it when they ask how you are doing. I would recommend this Insurance Co to anyone that drives. A+ Service... It doesn't get any better than that :)",

    "text": "My daughter has Progressive Insurance. Someone called her recently to offer her roadside assistance. She already had AAA but the offer made it sound like she would have increased benefits and advantages over  AAA. Today she had an opportunity to test that claim. Her key wouldn't turn in her ignition. She called Progressive and it became clear the weekend customer service people were not exactly the A team. \n     Her car was stuck in a parking garage of a shopping mall. It was a frigid 28 degrees that day. She made her first call and after repeating her policy number, name and other requested information several times, the representative disconnected her. The second call was with a representative that claimed she couldn't even find my daughters account or policy so my daughter was unable to even get road assistance. That phone call lasted 48 minutes with no success. The 3rd phone call was almost as frustrating but eventually, after repeating every detail once again over and over, a tow truck was scheduled to come tow her. \n    I should add at this time she mentioned each time to each representative her car was parked in a parking garage. We waited 90 minutes only to find out the tow truck height was taller than the garage entrance clearance. Therefor the truck could not get in to tow her vehicle. When she made the fourth call to request another tow truck she was told progressives policy was that you could not make more than one service request in a 24 hour period. Thus, she was out of luck, cold, stranded, exhausted and frustrated. But then she remembered she had AAA, made a call to them, and an hour later they were towing her car. Moral of the story is to not purchase Progressive Insurance roadside assistance because you will not get serviced by a competent individual, you will be treated poorly and disconnected, the representative will not listen to your situation  and ultimately you will not get the service you paid for. You will get a lot of corporate policy babble from uncaring representatives and left stranded and emotionally distraught. Stick with AAA.",

    "text": "I received a solicitation in the mail promising to insure my home for just $429. That's more than $200 less than what I currently pay. it sounded too good to be true and from a company I've never heard of before called Arizona Home Insurance Company (further investigation reveals the company is actually Western Mutual Insurance Group. Again, another company I've never heard of before. I was skeptical. I filled out the required information online on Friday night and a salesman called twice on Saturday, left one voicemail and then called again on Monday and left another voicemail. It said I could complete the application online, that I did not need to talk to anyone, but clicking the link resulted in taking me back to the original form I already filled out. When I called them, they said they needed to know the breed of my dog. I explained that I already put this information in the online form - a golden retriever mix. They said mixed with what? How should I know? What difference does it make? They said they WILL NOT insure any home that has a dog with Dalmatian, Chow, Pit Bull, and a couple of others I can't remember at the moment. Since I have no way of knowing what my dog is mixed with (and my dogs not telling me) they said I would be REQUIRED to send them a picture of my dog and an employee (not a canine biologist, or even a specially trained employee) but ANY employee (potentially) will examine the picture to determine if my dog is mixed with a 'dangerous' breed. Theoretically, I could send a picture of my dog under four different applications, and depending on the employee who evaluates the picture, I could be both approved and denied, depending subjective view of the employee.  I could also trim my dogs hair, or even Google 'Golden Retriever mix breed' and submit any photo that shows up. They have no way of knowing, but they are DISCRIMINATING against me because I refuse to send a picture of my assets to them prior to allowing them to bill me $429 (for the first year - it goes up after that, and it goes up again the year after that). Despite the fact I am more likely to bite someone in my home, I am more likely to set my house on fire (by mistake - my dog doesn't bite people or play with matches) and I own several guns, so if an intruder were to break into my home, the dog should be the least of their concerns. I am the dangerous one. I am the one seeking insurance. Not my dog. I have never filed an insurance claim (car or home) in my 25+ years of home ownership. I don't mind if they want DNA from my dog and want a canine biologist to determine his breed characteristics. I take issue with the inconsistent and non-scientific manner upon which they determine my eligibility. They don't ask if I smoke, they don't ask if I light candles, they don't ask if I work from home, they don't ask the age of the dog (an old arthritic dog that can't even get up without assistance is irrelevant to them.) This is judgmental discrimination placed solely in the hands of random, unqualified employees.\n\nFurthermore, numerous scientific studies have attempted to identify the number of annual dog bites, the dogs most likely to bite, the people most likely to be bitten, and the circumstances under which bites are most likely to occur. Such studies have not reached a uniform consensus and have left us with more questions than answers. Even the studies that have attempted to report on breeds' proclivity to bite have cautioned that their research is incomplete and should not be used to justify breed discrimination by legislatures or insurers.\nTo date, no scientific study has been able to resolve what I term to be the problem of \"numerators and denominators.\" A person wishing to determine whether certain breeds are more likely to bite than others must first determine the number of bites per breed (the numerator) and then compare that number to the total number of dogs of that breed in the general population (the denominator).",

    "text": "It's easy to get a person on the phone at Midfirst, but it turns out that speaking to a human being doesn't mean you'll be treated like one.  I've had three significant experiences at this bank in which the customer service was so low, it wasn't even there.  \n\nFirst, I spoke to someone about an auto refi who simply would not contact me back.  She would always tell me she was going to call, and then she wouldn't.  I ended up handling it with another bank.  She never followed up to find out.  I guess they're doing so well that they don't need any more ~extra business~!\n\nSecondly, I ordered a new debit card because they were running some kind of promo for the design cards.  You know, picture of a flower, your dog, etc.  Card never came.  I called them a month later, they cancelled it and sent another.  Card never came.  I called them a month later, they had no idea what was going on, and I told them to forget it.  NO FANCY CARD FOR ME.\n\nThird, there was a snafu between Midfirst and another bank that I use.  Midfirst was obviously completely to blame for the incident, but instead, the people I spoke with on the phone petulantly insisted that it was either my fault or the other bank's, but not theirs.  This went on for weeks, and ultimately, they did nothing to fix the problem or to retain my business.  Again, Midfirst must be doing REALLY WELL to just fling off customers like this.  It was such a minor issue that I could not believe not only the thinly veiled hostility from the people I spoke with, but that they would be so petty and ridiculous instead of just fixing the issue.  I'm not kidding when I say it could have been an easy fix.  I'm flexible!  But not when they are so openly unwilling to do the least thing to retain a customer.\n\nInstead, they fought with me like a middle school frienemy, and I am closing my account in disgust.  Almost every interaction that I have had with this bank has been annoying, and unusually devoid of customer service.  They don't even pretend over at the old Camelback location.  \n\nIn closing, worthless quality of service, time wasted, total mistake, closing account, do not recommend.",

When she finished, she asked me about my green card and she told me that i have to bring it to get a copy of it.. After three days she sent me a rude email saying ''bring the copy of your green card or come over and close your account if you don't want to comply'' !! Very Rude!!\nThe second bad experience was with Barbara, she is in charge of loans. After i submitted my application and emailed it to her, I asked her to let me know if she received it but i haven't heard from her, so i went to the bank and she was not there, so i gave it to one of the employees and asked hem to tell her to just email me  to make sure she received it.  I haven't heard from anyone for 12 days, then i went to the bank online  customer service to tell them about the issue.\n\nFinally! She got back to me already 2 weeks,,,I answered the phone,,,No apology or explanation about why she did not get back to me,,, she said that my personal credit is not that great, and they cannot give me any business loan!!\n\nI went to wells Fargo and i got a loan on a car for my business even though i do not have a business account with them. \nAlso, when you have an issue and you call the 1800 number, they ask you to call the branch were you opened the account. I am leaving them by the end of this year.\n\nSo, it might be good for a personal account but NOT RECOMMENDED for business.  Go to a reliable bank that can help you with your business.",

The first two attempts on the automated voice phone service failed after providing the information (correctly). Then a customer service rep comes on the line. He asks me to identify myself, which I did. Card number, last 4 of social, etc. Then he wants information about last check written, account number - all questions I'm not prepared to answer - I just need to activate the silly debit card! Then I get the checkbook in front of me and told him to ask me the questions again. Now he says he can't help me over the phone, I need to go into a branch! I told him to put a supervisor on the phone. He says that there was not one available, he would have one call me back in 24 hours. Ridiculous. I have never had a problem activating a Wells or BofA card. BMO Harris is apparently really challenged by this. NOT A FAN.",

I was a satisfied M&I customer for two years and as soon as BMO took over the finances (before the name change) it all went to heck. They immediately dropped my cash-back checking, and then wanted to charge me a monthly maintenance fee and ATM fees. I used to even get reimbursed fees if I went to a different bank's ATM, and now I have to pay $2 to access my own money? \n\nThe reason I chose M&I was because they weren't like the big bad banks (Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo). BMO Harris pretty much is the same as them, so I think not. I went to a credit union and I'm thrilled. 6% interest, online check deposit, no fees.",

I am updating this review because I do believe not everyone should suffer for one person's actions. I highly recommend this branch now due to Linda. Thank you again for your help. \n\n\n**I don't even know where to begin.  I normally don't name names, BUT I do believe this is a time to do so. Reason being for present and future customers need to know what they're dealing with, and not to mention this certain individual needs coaching on how to handle a \"professional\" work environment.  \n\nFirst of all, I don't appreciate how you handled or lack thereof my husband's business.  He simply needed to do a wire transfer and you were so focused on his t-shirt you just had to have everyone look at it. When he left, you simply said everything is done. He left and you called me to say you made a mistake and we waited for you to call back and it has been 4 hours. I have called 5 times. Thank goodness someone helped us after the 5th hour. My husband was going to be late for work. \n\nRosie, I am breaking up with OneNevada. Your customer service skills need help. I understand you have a busy working environment but I know for a fact you have time to call your customers back. I'll be back on Saturday to close our account.  I hope this will help you to grow and learn how to handle a professional situation.  I only hope for the best.**",

When monday rolls around my account is overdrafted because I couldnt make a payment in time to a payday loan because I couldn't get money out of the bank once my card was gone. So I wake up to an overdrafted account and they took money from my savings account without my permission as well. The credit union would not refund me for there mistake and told me I have eight days to make a payment or I will get charged 2.50 a day untill I fix the overdraft , I already pay 20 a month just to have the account.

Lately with all of the Obamacare hoopla, We visited the Culinary Union this past weekend to re-register for our benefits in order to weed out frauds and people who have been abusing the benefits by having people under their coverage who weren't even family!?\n\nBecause of the small size of the building and the 55,000+ members in the union, people had to endure at least a three hour process...one hour out in the cold, another hour and a half in the warming tent, and the last 30 minutes to get all the paperwork squared away. The workers were quick, efficient, and courteous.\n\nThis past Monday and Tuesday, people endured a 6 hour wait, so times may vary depending on how many people plan to show up. Also, check their website as the deadline has been extended and there will also be longer hours.  ALOHA!!!",

I do not \"have tons of money\" and I am not involved in the \"exciting world of investiment banking\" but have always been treated well at Busey.  All my banking is done there. I have been steered right in all my business -- refinancing, IRA, loans, whatever.  Was just in for retirement financial advice at the main branch and met with two very helpful, courteous, and personable young people (Daly and Adam) who set my mind at ease and followed up on our meeting.  For years I have worked with a delightful woman (Marsha) at The Pines who has been helpful, efficient, pleasant, and friendly.  It is always a pleasure to do business with her and she manages to remember my name no matter how long between contacts.  In the decades of business with Busey, I have never been treated with anything but professionalism and courtesy.  Online banking intimidated me but Busey's online banking has been easy to use. I would not hesitate to recommend Busey to any newcomer to C-U or to anyone looking to change their bank home.",

They called it the \"Opt-in\" program (without even defining what it was for customers!), as if it were a good thing, something new they had thought of for their precious clients. They did not inform anyone that this was required of them by the federal gov't. for their exorbitant check return fees. With this loophole (and duped customers) they managed to hang on to these scams, but the Obama admin. is on to them-they are following the 'law' but not the intent. Oh-we should thank them for their community work and being so nice to the few while ripping us off. Even their own employees cannot explain how it is that 'money' goes in an account, and yet NSF funds keep popping up! I am going elsewhere asap!!! I would give them -10 stars if I could!! Oh! and if your Busey card doesn't work, know that you won't get an answer until you ask!

It's at least a 7 hour round trip and understand that the Highway Patrol will pull you over for going faster than the posted 80 miles an hour speed limit.\n\nBut there's more to the state than the Canyon. The Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff was where Pluto was discovered. The Pima Boneyard is where old aircraft go when they're not needed any more. Monument Valley, on the Arizona/Utah border.

Very friendly tellers, speedy service, great all around.\n\nMy low score is because taking out a mortgage/construction loan with UW has possibly been the most infuriating experience ever. \n\nMy husband and I are a young couple, buying our first home so we know very little about the whole process. Both of us bank with UW though so it made complete sense to take out our loan here. The problem currently is no one can tell me what is going on with this loan. I can't see it online on my UW Dashboard, I was told, because its a construction loan. Um. Okay. So I can't track my loan or make payments online. So they tell me I have to mail in my first mortgage check, do on June 15th. Okay, no problem. Except its been 2.5 weeks since I mailed it and it hasn't been cashed. Me, trying to be the responsible party, calls UW to see if they've received it. Hmm. Well it looks your mortgage maybe with our mortgage servicer. Um. Well, okay. \n\nSo I'm transferred to the mortgage servicer. Only to be told they don't have my mortgage either. WHO AM I MAKING PAYMENTS TO AND WHERE IS MY CHECK?!\n\nAs a 29 year old with no prior experience in this area, I feel like I am being jerked around and not getting all the facts. Not only that, we had initial issues when first taking out the loan like getting timely responses. Oh, and when we signed our title they forgot to mention our contractor needed to be there as well. On a Friday morning. In rush hour. You know when we found that out? When the title company told us as we were signing the papers. No one from UW told us because we were having a construction loan that our contractor needed to be there.\n\nHopefully they get this worked out, because buying a house is already stressful enough without having all of this on my plate too.\n\n\n*UPDATE* We were given mortgage coupons with incorrect information so my first mortgage payment is out there floating around in space.",

I had to deal with 3 different employees so I will name them #1, #2, #3.. \nI stood in line and when I finally got to employee #1, I told her I was picking up money through western union. She proceeded to ask me, \"is this your first time withdrawing money from us?\" Clearly didn't hear a word I said. She then directed me to the counter with the paperwork that needed to be filled out. I filled out the only thing that was in English (other papers were in Spanish). I went back in line for the second time. When I reached #1, she told me to fill out the other paper that was only in Spanish. I then stood in line for the third time. A male walked into the store and instead of taking me when I was next in line, #2 helped him out first. #3 opened up her window and said, \"next person,\" which would have been me, but she took someone else also. When #2 was done with the guy, she finally called on me. She could not pull up the transaction since \"the number was wrong.\" I attempted to show her my phone which had the picture of the receipt texted to me, and she didn't bother to look at it. Her response was, \"maybe you got the number wrong.\" I told her, \"how could I get the number wrong when I have a picture of the receipt right here?!\" She didn't bother using my name to look it up or anything. She basically refused to help me since the number didn't work. I walked out and went to the location on fort apache where they helped me with no issues and I was in and out in 3 minutes!",

Aren't they typically impersonal, aloof and indifferent?\n\nThis bank does have one teller, Ms. Kitchens, who smashes the stereotype. She's very sweet, helpful, and knowledgeable. There is no future for her in banking.\n\nI would have switched to Washington Mutual a long time ago except that it's a pain to switch banks.  I applied for a car loan online and it was denied the instant I clicked the mouse. Click-DENIED. How is that possible? I've never had the slightest problem getting credit. Suspecting a glitch, I tried calling my branch. You can't get through. It takes hours.\n\nI spoke to a jerk. I explained the situation. I have more money in the bank than the amount of the loan. Any suggestions? \n\nHe talked to me like he was dealing with a welfare cheat. He said I could apply again but it would hurt my credit rating. Too many inquiries. I don't want to apply again.  Can someone review my application?  We can't do that blah blah blah--a smokescreen of anti-customer jargon. \"You must have something wrong with your credit history,\" he advised. You're probably a deadbeat, in other words.\n\nWhat kind of scenario would have made me happy?  \"I see Mr. Q . that you've been banking with us for 12 years and you have more money in your account than the loan you applied for. We certainly appreciate your business. Let me check on this and I'll get back to you.\" I'm dreaming, right?\n\nThe bank sends you a form letter with an 800 number to find out why you didn't get the loan. I didn't bother. I ended up getting a loan elsewhere with better--that's right, BETTER--terms. \n\nAfter 12 years of banking with B of A they let me down the first time I asked anything of them. Apparently they have an algorithm that evaluates your record and renders a decision in milliseconds. That's all I was entitled to. It wasn't anything personal.\n\nI didn't close my account on principle because it doesn't make any difference to them. They don't have an algorithm for angry customers. It would just mean more inconvenience for me.\n\nAny bank will give you the same treatment. Their strength isn't serving you; it's dreaming up outrageous new fees for granting you the privilege of depositing your money with them.\n\nUPDATE: I finally closed my account. Never again. I went with Wells Fargo. Not that they're any better. They're all thieves. Wells Fargo says their free checking will never change. We'll see.\n\nI feel good about breaking with B of A because of their shameful conduct in the mortgage meltdown. They're all about throwing people out of their homes just to secure fraudulent profits. Shame on them. I urge all yelpers to boycott B of A, an institution that should have failed. Thank you.",

He was very nice and personable.  He was not rushed, and made me feel very comfortable.  I'm a young woman, and sometimes people can make you feel intimidated.  But not Mr. Gallacher!  \n\nWe've since moved from Arizona, but I think I will have him do our 2011 taxes as well!  Its not easy finding an accountant that you really like!",

    "text": "I'm updating this review solely as a response to AZFCU's response to my initial review.  It is their response that downgrades them to 1 star, and has now put changing credit unions on the table.  I think whoever delegated the task of responding to Yelp reviews ought to reconsider their choice.\n\nFirstly, they addressed their closing of the Desert Ridge with a backhanded apology in the form of :\n\n\"We understand it can be concerning when the location nearest to you closes - especially so soon after you became a member here - and apologize if the letters and emails we sent did not reach you\"\n\nA proper apology doesn't include an opportunity to save face by mentioning that you sent me letters about the closing branch and thereby insinuating something like  \"it's not like we didn't tell you about it\".  Apology not accepted.  I never got any notice in any form.  I challenge you to provide me with proof of mailing of those letters.\n\nSecondly, notice how the responder glosses over the issue of the initial 60-day blackout on remote deposits, WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE INCONVENIENT FOR MANY NEW CUSTOMERS. AZFCU, if you're going to respond, then bring a proper response that addresses ALL of the noted concerns.\n\nFInally, I'll supplement my original post by offering Yelp readers and potential AZFCU customers another word of warning:(in case AZFCU's haphazard attempt at a response isn't repellent enough):  If you're a couple who wants to maintain separate accounts, have a joint account, and link them all together, then prepare to waste an hour of your Saturday signing you name umpteen times and listening to endless disclosures.  IT LITERALLY TOOK AN HOUR.  I'm not kidding.  It was the most convoluted banking procedure we ever witnessed. \n\nMy thanks to whomever wrote that reply.  In trying to defend AZFCU, you ended up giving credibility to my original advice: LOOK ELSEWHERE TO HANDLE YOUR BANKING NEEDS.",

    "text": "Clark Howard recommends credit unions over banks. However I would not recommend this credit union over most banks. My problems with them:\n\n1) They charge you $3/month to each and every member, no matter what. With my current bank, all monthly fees are waived since I have direct deposit. Not so with AZFCU. $3/month, regardless.\n2) After seven ATM withdrawals in a month, you're charged a hefty fee for each additional ATM transaction. I found this out the hard way when I visited Europe and would withdraw relatively small amounts each time, so that I wasn't carrying too much cash on me. I get home and what do I find? Fees out the wazoo. My current bank has no such limit.\n3) Their loan rates are noncompetitive. Even as a member I was always able to get better loan rates at other banks. And I'm talking a couple of house refis, a home equity line of credit, and a car loan. I always did better going outside the credit union.\n\nMaybe Clark Howard has other credit unions in mind when he recommends them over the \"big monster mega-banks.\" This isn't one of them.",

The only option is to \"move money\" from their savings account onto the secured credit card. It's 2013 people!!!

An hour wait for a simple freaking question from a new member!!\nAfter some research online, I found out I can pay my VISA secured credit card with a debit card from a different bank, by paying a $18 \"surcharge\" fee. How the hell am I supposed to pay them?? Go to the freaking branch in person to pay a simple credit card??\nNo answers. Left a voicemail to the lady who opened my account and hopefully she will get back to me.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter an hour wait on the phone, I finally got to talk to someone and they did tell me I cannot make an online payment using the checking account from a different bank. I can only pay it online using the debit card from a different bank and paying the $18 fee. Or I can pay using the checking account from a different bank over the phone, pay a $5 fee and it takes up to 4 days to process. Or I can go in person, give them my debit card from a different bank and be charged a non-bank atm fee by my bank. What a mess. I'm closing my account and going someplace else.",

Not only did I realize that it was my mistake but the employee then referred me to some free resources of government sponsored programs that would help me resolve other issues.\nSo yet again the people of Arizona Federal Credit Union have come through and really helped me.\nThank you all.",

I was informed that because i don't have an account there they were unable to do this for me. You are a bank, you have money right??? I went across the street to 1st Bank and they did it no questions asked. Just because im not a current customer doesn't mean i wouldn't be a future customer. I loved going back out in 110 degree heat to drive across the street to a bank that did what any bank can and should do. I just moved to this area but you are making my options of which bank to move to much shorter...so thank you.",

Now that AIG is managing it, there is a lot of red tape you have to go through to getting your claim paid. When they deny the claim, they send you an Explanation of Benefits state that has no explanation on it, and no phone number to call. It is up to you to figure out how to write an appeal letter. I was very happy when Lot Solutions managed this program....they were a 5 start company. With the new management, I'm debating dropping this insurance.",

I have had full home owners insurance through All State and full health coverage through my employer, so there is no reason I would have ever authorized this charge for an insurance services that seems to be a scam.\n\nI am amazed that Wells Fargo is associated with this company as I have always appreciated working with them, but the fact that they allow their name to be used in conjunction with a fraudulent service makes me want to switch financial institutions entirely.",

    "text": "In March, I opened a \"Kasasa\" Checking account.  It refunds All ATM fees and pays 2% interest  Unheard of at most banks.  The key is when you use your check-card, you have to press credit and NOT use your PIN.  You have to do that 15 times a month or you don't get the refund.  The problem I had, their security is set so hi, my spending habits shut the card down.  I was never sure which transaction did it, but they never called to see if it was actually my transaction before blocking the card.  \n\nI coud still do transactions with a PIN number, but that practice goes against the way the account is supposed to function.  I called after about a week of getting declines.  I was out of town and the woman in card services asked if I had left AZ, when I said yes a travel for my job she said that was the reason.  All transactions out of AZ will apparently lock the card.  Most institutions only do this if you leave the country.  She offered to permanently lift the restriction but I declined and said I would just come in and close the account.  I did not want to take the risk of them telling me I waived my fraud rights if I actually had an identity theft with the account.",

Over that time I've had auto and personal loans, savings and checking accounts with direct deposits and a credit card with a great rate.\nAbout 6 or so years ago Riverset took over and this place went downhill fast. Their goal now is not customer service but to maximize profit.\nIn June 2015 I received a letter telling me my credit card rate would be increasing but not by how much. I was assured that they would let me know the increase amount in the coming months and that it would be SOMETHING plus prime. I was further assured that until such time they figure out what that SOMETHING is they were going to raise the rate over 30%! Since I'd never missed a payment despite their lengthy crediting period, I assume it was a mistake. So I called and was politely told that the reason they were raising rates was because they \"weren't making enough money with the lower rate\"!!!\nI spoke to a manager, pointed out to her that interest rates across the boards are at the lowest levels in decades and that I'd been a loyal customer for over 20 years, she just confirmed the fact that the sole reason to increase rates was \"we are not making enough profit at the lower rate\". Also when asked she could not tell me what the ultimate rate would be.\n\nGO ELSEWHERE",

Please be aware of the sarcasm in my writing. \n\nLike most people, I worked hard for the money I entrusted Riverset with. I'm very upset with the direction of this financial establishment handles it customers. I would say they are rude, but they're rarely available to solve problems. When problem's do arise, they treat your situation as if it is not important or give you grief for calling and asking questions about your account. Again, I was hit with an over draft fee, but this time three in a row. The kicker is that I did, do, and still have the amount that was needed to pay the bills. From the notice I received about the overdraft fees, it even states I have a balance that can take care of the bills I had needed to pay. What drives it home is when they don't want to correct this. This was the best financial institution to have, but as soon as they went from PTCU to Riverset things started to slip. They have so many back door policies that forces you to agree or you can't check your accounts. I've just reported them to BBB.org, and people who are choosing banks need to understand that Credit Unions are good, but this one is on \"the evil list\" for sure. Just another small financial institution who likes to overcharge. My advice is to try PSECU if your in PA. They are open on Saturdays and open late on Weekdays. Riverset is failing and they know it! Which is why every other day you login to your account your always agreeing to a back door policy or you can't have access to your money. I hope my two comments can steer newcomers away and hopefully current members can speak up about their bad experiences. I just read some more policies and found either way if I would have put a stop payment on each bill I've paid, they would have charged me $30 for each one. Either way I had to pay an overdraft fee or the cancellation fee. They both are $30 dollars for each transaction. I can't wait for their reason and explanation on this.",

I called my credit card company and they responded immediately and took care of it for me!  In October we got hit with their new \"low balance fee\" for anyone who doesn't have credit cards or loans with Riverset - no letter of warning or email 30 days before like banks always do.  We have over $2000 a month in direct deposit, and we get punished with a $7 a month fee for \"low balance\"???  This is outrageous for a credit union.  This is something to be expected from a bank - and we have accounts with other major banks and they always forewarn.  That's supposed to be the selling point with a credit union - free checking.  \nAnd last week I attempted to renew my AVG antivirus and once again Riverset blocked it because it came from the Netherlands, the 3rd year in a row, despite emailing them last year to unblock it.  This time I got the usual robocall from their security and called their automated line, no human of course.  I clicked \"1\" to indicate yes, I did authorize it.  And a few days ago AVG informed me it was denied!! There was more than enough money to pay it.  What part of \"yes I authorized this transaction\" is difficult to comprehend?  I got on live chat with AVG and had to use my Citizens debit card, and it was paid within seconds!  I shouldn't have to get permission to authorize automatic debits with my own money as long as the money's there in my account.\nAs for their e-statements?  They're a jumbled mess, with no beginning and ending balance, all thrown together.  My 14-year-old could do a better job.\nWith the punitive \"low balance\" fee, we are in process of getting out.  And the \"convenient\" locations?  They're convenient only if you work or live in Shadyside or Southside and can get there before 4:30, and definitely not by bus.  I went to Southside for the first and only time last summer to deposit into my husband;s account.  The teller expected me to say my husband;s Social Security number out loud.  I of course refused.  I got married in 2011 and they're still using my former name in online transfers, despite numerous emails and refused to give me free checks in my new name - but Citizens had no problem doing that.",

The wonderful financial professionals on the Customer Service team at our local Chase Bank branch, which does not have a mortgage banker on staff there, referred us to Ryan Jones at the Frank Lloyd Wright-100th St branch in Scottsdale.  It turned out to be a very fortuitous referral for us, and we simply have to tell everyone about it.\n\nThe succinct description is that our recent mortgage banking experience was legendary!  This dramatic description is really not much of an exaggeration.  Not only did we close on our purchase mortgage nearly two full weeks sooner than first planned, we closed on the primary residence's refinancing mortgage the same day!   Ryan Jones, as the mover and shaker in both processes, was doggedly determined to burnish Chase Bank's mortgage reputation to its shiniest ever.  He did so through 1) constant contact with us his customers - almost daily contact at times!, 2) very clear explanations of technical financial terms as well as very clear explanations of what could be considered tedious mortgage application processes and 3) offering us a Chase Bank refinancing options that we were previously unaware of to move us into a considerably more advantageous financial position than we were in before.  Ryan always made himself available to us by cell phone, and he was always patient with his answers to our many, many questions.  He was refreshingly the complete opposite of some of those banking reps, who don't care, whether they come off as condescending to us homebuyers.  The plain fact is, not only are we extremely happy with our purchase mortgage, we are ecstatic with the refinanced mortgage. \n\nIt never hurts to talk!  Decide for yourself after you talk with Ryan Jones of mortgage banking at the Frank Lloyd Wright-100th St Chase Bank branch in Scottsdale.",

While I am not doing my mortgage through Chase, I do bank here and needed bank statements and documents notarized. Every time I've gone, the employees were quick to greet me and ask what I needed. If they couldn't help me, they would direct me to the correct person. Every time the employees were friendly and courteous. I was able to get in and out relatively quickly and always with exactly what I needed. This was a great experience. I have also used this bank as a quick ATM (which is inside) or as a quick deposit through the drive thru. My wait has never been long and I like that.

    "text": "You want to be treated less than human while injured from an automobile accident?... well then you've found the place. They literally add insult to injury.\n\nSarcasm aside, I echo the other reviewers' assessments of this business and caution those reading this review to stay away. My husband and I were involved in an accident approximately 3 years ago. This was our first MVA, and we were both injured and na\u00efve as to what to do. Under the advisement of our physician we decided to seek out a professional law firm to represent us through this scary process. At the time, this firm did not have a Yelp rating; otherwise I would have steered clear. \n\nWe have spent over 2  1/2 years dealing with the inadequate, unprofessional service and the disrespect that this firm chooses to dole out to their clients. The paralegal assigned to our case failed to send important documents through the mail as required, and it is typical for emails and voicemails to go unreturned. More than once I felt that I was putting the attorney out by requesting information; and more than once the attorney would not deign to speak with me but rather instructed me to follow through with the paralegal that refused to return my calls. \n\nDuring the actual depositions and arbitration, I felt that the Phillips attorneys were ill-informed and fumbling. This is by no fault of mine or my husband's as we were highly prepared and provided detailed updates to each of the half dozen attorneys that our case changed hands through. From one month to the next, our case was turned over to a new attorney and we had to explain who we were all over again. Even at the time that I arrived to pick up my settlement check, the paralegal still had no idea who I was or who was involved in my case. I understand this firm has many clients, but in this type of matter diligent note taking and bookkeeping should be the standard. Just to provide the reader with an idea of how this firm drags their feet - our settlement checks arrived May 14th, meaning the firm can deposit checks with our POA documents and then pay out clinicians, take their 40% add in any medpay from the insurance company and then cut us a check. I only received my portion last week and my husband still hasn't received an update on his. Today is July 2nd. Over the past 7 weeks his 5 emails have gone completely unreturned. If we do not hear back by next week we will contact the AZ Attorney Consumer Assistance Program. \n\nMy advice to anybody facing litigation due to a personal injury case is to fully research the firm you choose. I am now kicking myself for not putting more time into my search. My only explanation for choosing this joke business is that I was injured, scared and desperately wanted somebody to tell me that they were going to help me. In an automobile accident a person already feels that they need to be guarded against the other drivers and insurance companies and defense attorneys. They shouldn't feel like they require protection from their own attorney as well. In the case of Phillips Law Group, what you see in your initial consultation is NOT what you get. The expensive advertising, the high rise office space and office girls in 5 inch stiletto's is all a smoke and mirror facade in the end.",

    "text": "Public beware DO NOT use this dealership's service department under any circumstance. This has to be the  MOST NEGLIGENT, INCOMPETENT and DISHONEST service department on the planet.\n\nPlease allow me to get you up to date on my situation. My Jeep Wrangler has had a recall issued for defective side view mirrors with defrost due to the potential of an electrical fire. This in my opinion is a VERY serious recall. This has gone on for over a year.  I continue to receive notices by mail, constant emails and voice messages (at least 3 times a week) from Jeep corporate as to how urgent this situation is and that I need to have the issue fixed immediately.  I have tried NUMEROUS times to have this dealership fix the recalled items and I have been told repeatedly that they don't have the parts. Six months ago, I took my Jeep in for an oil change and again inquired as to when the parts may be available. I was told by my service adviser, Crystal Melton, that they could \"remove the fuse to disable the defrost mechanism on the mirrors to prevent a potential fire until the parts come in\". On my very next visit for another oil change, I again asked if the parts were available yet again. Once more I was told NO by Jay Rappaport (service adviser). Upon further discussion with Jay Rappaport I mentioned that I was glad that they had removed the fuse to prevent an electrical fire and he asked me who had told me that and I replied Crystal Melton (service adviser). He then informed me that removing the fuse was not possible. She (Crystal Melton the service adviser at the next desk over) then looked at me and said that she had never told me any such thing. I then asked Jay to pull up my history of visits at the dealership and it was clearly stated on my paperwork that, YES indeed, Crystal Melton (service adviser) had typed on my invoice dated 12-1-14 that \"the fuse for the side view mirrors had been removed to prevent a potential electrical fire until parts are available\". Needles to say she was pretty embarrassed when she realized that I had caught her in a bold face lie. \n\nNow fast forward to Wednesday 05-11-16.\nI called the dealership to set up an appointment for another oil change and asked the service adviser if they had the parts in yet for my recall. He then told me that he would have to have the parts department call me back to let me know if my parts were in and they would set the appointment up for me if so. I then patiently waited for several hours and finally a female from the parts department returned my call and informed me that the parts were indeed in and that I could bring my Jeep in on Saturday 05-14-16 at 10:00am and that the service would take 3 hours to perform. I was also told when I inquired about getting a loaner vehicle during this time that they were short on loaners and that I would have to schedule my appointment 10 days out if I wanted a loaner. Seeing that this is a serious recall, I decided to forgo the loaner and get it taken care of as soon as they could get me in and I told her that I would be there at 10:00am on Saturday.\n\nSaturday 05-14-16\nI arrived at Gastonia Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram at 10:00am to drop my Jeep off for an oil change and a much anticipated sigh of relief to get the recall issue taken care of once and for all (I thought). I worked with Jay Rappaport  (service adviser). He checked my car in, took my key and told me it would be ready in about 6 hours. Contrary to what the lady in parts had told me earlier in the week when she said it would only be 3 hours. Again, I didn't mind too much because I thought this nightmare with the recall would be over once and for all.\n\nI waited 5 and a half hours and then called the dealership to see if my Jeep was ready for pickup. The lady on the phone told me that she would have Jay Rappaport (my service adviser) call me back. Thirty minutes later I get a call from Jay Rappaport (service adviser) notifying me that my Jeep was ready for pick up that ALL work had been completed.\n\nI arrived at the dealership shortly after 4:00pm and checked in with Jay Rappaport (Service adviser). He printed out my paperwork and then, to my DISMAY, casually mentioned that they didn't get to my recall issue because they didn't have the parts. At first, I thought he was joking, but then I realized that he was serious. I then let him know my frustrations with him and the dealership he works for. I asked how this could happen and he said that they had somehow \"put the parts that were on reserve for my Jeep onto SOMEONE ELSE'S VEHICLE\". He had absolutely NO concern or remorse about this HUGE mistake. All he would say to me was...\"Sir please don't yell\" as I began to raise my voice as I tried to convey my thoughts to him. \n\nI must say...I have never seen a company employee so many INCOMPETENT employees and I have no idea how they stay in business. \n\nPUBLIC BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!! \nIf you want your vehicle repaired properly, this is not the place to go.",

I waited for him to finish up his phone call, during that period of time he was joking and laughing with the person on the phone and not talking business,  so right away I could tell that this is going to be a waste of time. I should've walked out right there but I was stupid and stayed around.\n\nNext I was seated with a personal banker who had a dual appointment with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.\n\nI gave him my ATM card and asked that he look up my accounts. I have three checking accounts with Bank of America and one savings.  I wanted to see if there was a way I could still keep one of my smaller checking account even though I wasn't going to have a minimum $1500 in that account at all times.  I was experiencing an $18 per month fee which would basically make the account pointless because I was going to be paying more in fees than I was getting out of it.  I keep that checkbook in my bag to pay simple league fees for shooting.  Even though it's been years since I was in college, Bank of America made simple modifications in the past and changed this small account over to campus edge checking.  I find out it has done away with that now because they just want more fees.  Don't make enough money and they want to squeeze their customers more?\n\nThe only thing that this guy wanted to do was help me move my brokerage accounts and my profit-sharing and 401(k) over from Wells Fargo. I told him that I just wanted to avoid the $18 per month checking account fee on this 16 year old account THEN he had to get up and go talk to a branch manager. He came back he said that he and the branch manager talked about it because I don't have direct deposit or the minimum amount that they wanted that there was no way that they can help me.  It was basically ridiculous and Bank of America sucks for charging continuous fees for a customer that they have had since the 1990s.  If it wasn't so much trouble for me to change banks I would do it then I'd have to figure out a way to notify all of the companies that I have making automatic debits from my other checking accounts.

I needed to prove to a mortgage company that I had made a deposit in the Bank of America. The manager went out of his way to see that my funds had cleared and provided me with a statement to give to the mortgage agent. It saved our deal. I will probably drive all the way to this branch from Summerlin if I need to go to a bank in person.",

I was so happy for this new location to open and I'm even more pleased with the new renovations made to the building.\n\nThe staff here is by far one of the most genuine, kind groups of people I have ever come across in a business. I have yet to visit this location and have a bad experience. The tellers are always smiling and greet me with a friendly hello (which we all know on certain days can be the highlight of our day) The Branch manager here Loree is an all-star! She used to be at the main location (Black Canyon Freeway and Cactus) but is now working at this new location on Bell. Loree is always willing to go above and beyond to help out customers (even staying a few minutes past closing hours when I annoyingly stroll in five minuets before they close... Sorry Loree :] ) She is extremely knowledgeable and trustworthy (obviously this is extremely important when it comes to people who are dealing with my money). I've followed her to this location because I know I can always count on her to answer all my questions. Ed the older gentleman that works here is a hoot! I absolutely love his personality! He always brightens up my day by cracking a funny joke or just simply putting a warm smile on his face! The other tellers here are just as wonderful and always are in good moods which always makes for an enjoyable environment.\n\nThis credit union has low rates for personal loans around  7.90% which in comparison to other personal loans is extremely low so for this I do thank you! Sunwest is also insured by the National Credit Union Association which helps once again ease my mind. They have 7 locations around the state and also do shared branching which makes it easier for me and I'm sure other customers to deposit money regardless of what area of town you are in . I also like that you have several different options when it comes to managing your accounts. You can choose to have money transfers automatically take place monthly without having to set yourself a reminder, they have direct deposit available which for me is extremely helpful. This credit union also has overdraft protection fees which we all know is important. Another great selling point about this company is that they also have notary public services available at all of the seven branches, and ding-ding-ding these services are at no charge to members. \n\nSo if you are sick of people you don't trust messing around with your money, if you're sick of outrageous interest rates and rude bank tellers make the switch to Sunwest and I'm sure you will be the happiest you have ever been with a Bank/Credit union!! Oh and I did forget to mention that if you suggest Sunwest to a friend or family member and they do go open an account I believe that Sunwest gives you 10  ( I'm not positive on the amount, but who cares its free money).\n\nThanks for making my life easy and hassle free if I could give this location ten stars I would!",

They said they would hold our loan approval for sixty days and to go in to the branch when we could and they would do the paperwork.

My girlfriend and I went in to open a joint account with both of us already having Chase.  The PB was not very knowledgeable and might have had a long night.

He had so many other cases that he couldn't focus on the details of mine.  It was up to me to ensure that the court received the correct information in time for the projected court date. This place was terrible about returning phone calls, and/ or getting paperwork out on time.  Also, my case required that I appear in court. The lawyer assigned to me from this office reassured me that they would appear in my place. This was far from the truth. I was called a day prior to the court appearance to show up to court by 9am. I was fortunate enough to be available and appear on time. I could've handle this entire case myself but I decided to be on the safe side and hire an attorney. Even though I won my case, I would never use these people again. Winning the case is the only reason why I didn't take further action in reporting these individuals. They were very unprofessional and seemed incompetent at times.\u00a0I am a very reasonable person, most people would not of put up with this level of unprofessionalism. So, this review is merely to help others and hopefully persuade them to spend their hard earned money at another law firm.\n\nNote: My first contact with this Law Office was located on North 83rd near Peoria, AZ close to the Arrowhead Mall.",

Chance treats every customer like a friend. He comes right to my home at times that are convenient for me about our insurance needs. He is never pushy or tries to sell me things I don't need. He doesn't try to oversell. As a family man himself he understands the dynamic of choosing the right products for the individual rather than trying to fit the individual into a box. He even takes the time to review my account and make suggestions or even to say hey, reviewed your account and we are right on target. \n\nWhenever I have a question, Chance is a phone call or email away. I can always count on him or a person from the office to get back to me promptly. While Farmers might not always have the cheapest price, I'm actually willing to pay a little more because I have a guy like Chance on my side looking out for me and for my family. \n\nChance can count on us to be a customer for life.",

I didn't use my card... Nobody ever said that this would cause a problem... I was never told this could be a problem and why would it be?  My accounts came up for financial review - now what the heck is that?  After weeks of calls and weeks of questions - LOTS AND LOTS OF QUESTIONS.  I finally got someone to tell me that my cards came up for review because I wasn't using my card on the corporate account and they wanted to be sure that I could support any and all charges that the additional card holder was spending.  Okay that is fair but I was exhausted now, the process to find out why I was being treated as though I did something wrong was exhausting.  Not to mention I am super busy running businesses and using Amex!  I supplied AMEX with everything they asked for - phone call after phone call.  Finally I got to what I was told to the end of the process and everything looked good but there was a form that they didn't like the size of the font...YES that is what they said!!  Are you serioius!!  If filling out this form incorrectly could cause an account to be closed shouldn't they have a standard form that you just sign??  Are they setting you up to fail?? I had submitted this form to them several times and they accepted it but now they wanted the font bigger.  I made it bigger but I guess this time I forgot to check a box and the font was too big on one area.  Did I get a phone call NO - was my financial documentation in order - YES - Could I support ALL Charges - YES!!  I was away on business the last couple of days and as I was paying for a taxi and my card didn't work.  I looked at my emails thinking - Oh Amex thinks this may be fraud and they are looking out for me...I got an email from AMEX telling me that my ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED!!!  My twenty plus year relationship with them was DONE over a box not being checked and a font size!!!  ALL FIVE CARDS - a few I have Businesses that I RUN MY BUSINESS WITH AMEX.  Are you kidding me!!!  I didn't do anything wrong - no late pays - nothing nothing nothing WRONG!!!  American Express shame shame shame on you!!!   I am moving to the CHASE card never to return to AMEX - please join me - Stay away from AMERICAN EXPRESS !!",

    "text": "Our loan was transferred to RoundPoint from NCUA and ever since then we have been consistently harassed and threatened via telephone and mail. As of January 2013 our loan with NCUA was transferred to RoundPoint Mortgage Corp. Since that time both myself and my husband have been harassed with phone calls and letters with threats to report negatively on our good credit if we didn't pay an extra payment because their system shows a payment is missing. I have provided copies of our bank accounts showing every payment was not only made, but, that they are set up and paid automatically via online bill pay with our banking institute. The payments are electronic payments so the funds are immediately in their account. I have faxed and mailed copies of our statements. I've filed formal complaints with RoundPoint the FTC and Charlotte BBB. I have spoken to countless representatives of RoundPoint inquiring as to which payment specifically they claim is missing. I have been told a different answer by each representative. Initially, it was the Nov 2012 payment that was paid to NCUA, then the Dec 2012 payment. Thereafter, I have been told it was the February 2013 payment and the April 2013 payment. We have received countless phone calls and each representative claims to not have any knowledge of all the information I have provided and will not let me speak to a supervisor. If I persist they will then relent and say they can see in the notes in the system where I have provided copies of my bank statements. I have contacted our banking institute and opened inquiries on each individual payment. I filled out a Third Party Authorization form with RoundPoint allowing them to discuss our account with a representative of our banking institute. I have provided copies of the Oct & Nov checks paid to NCUA as those were the payments needed per the conversation between RoiundPoint & our Bank representative. In addition to speaking to representative on a near daily basis since January 2013, I have asked to speak to a supervisor and am always told \"they're in meeting.\" When I asked how it was possible that they were always in meetings January through April every time I am speaking to a representative the girl told me, \"well, they're meetings are back to back.\" THey are threatening foreclosure, threatening to report us delinquent to the credit agencies and the only solution we've ever been given is \"pay an extra payment.\" The issue is within their company, they can't tell me specifically which payment is missing, as I stated each representative says it's a different one. During one phone call I was told their system shows all the payments were made but the April payment shows \"blank.\" When I asked what that even meant, she said, it looks like someone entered the payment but not the amount paid! How am I supposed to rectify problems within their system? I have done everything I know to do to provide proof of our payments. We are being treated as though we are bad debtors. We are being harassed with threats of ruining our excellent credit if we don't comply to their \"solution\" of paying an extra payment.\" Their representatives are not helpful but refuse to let me speak to a supervisor. Most recently when I complained about the consistent phone calls and the fact that I had provided all proof of payments the representative said, \"I can see where we call you a lot & I will remove your number from our system so we won't be able to call you.\" While I appreciate the idea, it does not solve the problem that they're not fixing their system to accurately show our payments have all been received. I have sent faxes to various representatives and departments...Rodney, The Cashier's Dept., Jeffrey Engstrom & The Payoff Req Dept. in the hopes that someone in any of these departments will follow through on this and make sure it is properly resolved. I have spoken to Amanda, Julie, Jonathan, Jason, Rodney & Yosef in addition to others I wasn't able to write down. Even after all this they still continue to threaten us with foreclosure and a negative credit report!",

They seemed to be working their best NOT to send us our funds due after our water loss. \n\nThanks to my lengthy initial Yelp review discussing our RMP nightmare, we received an immediate message response offering assistance from the Social Media Manager, Omar P.. We wish we'd have had such diligent and consistent follow up from the beginning but alas, such wasn't the case. \n\nWe filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today as recommended by a few fellow helpful Yelpers, just in case this was another \"pretending to get things finalized\" by RMP loss draft department.\n\nThis all should not have gotten to this point and would not have had RMP done right by their clients. Thank you Omar! He actually deserves a 5* rating for his diligence and respectful handling of our case. He helped move our reimbursement process along in one week while we'd been dealing with RMP shenanigans for over 2 months. Today's midnight update at RMP reflects payment status FINALLY pending.\n\nHopefully Omar can continue working to change the course of things for the better for clients who deal with problems with RMP loss draft tom foolery and imbecility.",

I was bummed when I rec'd notice they were  transferring to Roundpoint in early Dec 2013. But, I know this happens and is normal.\n\nFirst and foremost, I could not even get a human rep on the phone with the # provided on the letter. I had to dig and Google alternate numbers to get a human. I was then told I had a 60-day \"grace period\" by this rep to get everything set up and not worry about mortgage payments, late fees until 2/3/14. Okay, great! I documented this, of course.\n\nLast Friday, I find a \"Confidential\" door hanger on my front door. WTF? I open and find myself \"delinquent\" w/Roundpoint? What??? I call them today and speak w/Crystal. She was pretty blas\u00e9 and tells me I owe almost $3k in back mortgage and basically that I must have misunderstood or gotten bad info last Dec. I calmly read back my documentation to her. She again apologizes.\n\nLong story made short - I still need to cough up the back $, but can do it over 3-mo period to soften the huge blow.\n\nGuess I wouldn't be so passionate if I was working right now, but I'm on Short Term disability due to ACL surgery and only getting 60% of paycheck. GREAT fucking timing!!!!!\n\nI'm not impressed and very upset w/this entire situation. I'm not a person who would just blow something like this off. I want my Cobalt Mortgage back. :(",

    "text": "RoundPoint acquired my mortgage after I refinanced with another company. I made my payments on time, and everything was good - until I had a need for customer service. They contacted me regarding a payment made to my home insurer and wanted me to pay them back. I don't escrow, so I called my insurer. They confirmed that RoundPoint had paid them for a year of insurance as part of my refinance. Sounded good to me, so I paid them back. A month later I happened to come across the paperwork for the refinance, and a quick review showed that I had paid for that year of insurance as part of the closing (which I now know is common). I thought this was a simple mix-up, and I paid twice. They should be able to check that and remedy it, or show me that I'm wrong. I've contacted them by phone several times, and eventually I was told to email them. I did that and only got an automated response - that was January 13th; never heard from anyone looking into it. I called back and asked for a real person's email address. Qadirah Ellison has managed to ignore my emails from January 20 and 29. I ended up sending a letter with the HUD statement by certified mail which they received on February 17th. I called today to check on the status of that and was told they don't have any updates and to email them (that was rich). Today I submitted a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but it's sad that it has come this far. I hope to update this soon, but for now 1 star!",

    "text": "Awful. Stay away. Our mortgage was sold to them back in January.  I believe everything would be fine if you never need to speak to them. If you do need to contact them, be prepared to be on hold for days. I initially tried to call them back in April, on hold for average of 45 mins each call. When you finally get someone on the phone, good luck understanding them. They have an office in Manilla which I unfortunately always seem to get. I asked my question, which should be simple, and didn't get an answer. I was transferred, while on hold again call for an additional 15 minutes, all of a sudden the call was dropped. This happened around 4 more times. Finally reach someone that I could understand and she informed me you can request to speak to the US office but somehow I feel like an awful person making this request. Either way, I was told to send an email. I received email confirmation that my email had been received. However, I didn't hear from them again. I called them again....same issues. Finally on March 27, over a month later I received a letter in the mail with instructions for my request. I still needed to speak with someone though. I began the impossible process to get someone on the phone that I could understand and that actually had answers to my questions.  It is now nearing July....still no answer and a seemingly impossible company to have a conversation with. Stay away at all cost.",

Check my other reviews and you can see I too have had a bad mortgage experience with another provider.  Regardless, Round Point acquired my loan about a year ago.  Truthfully, I have had to call twice about a discrepancy in my payment amount or the escrow balance being incorrect.  Not sure I love that it got screwed up somehow on two occasions, but I can say that the customer service people I worked with on both occasions were helpful, gave me a clear resolution time and delivered on it.  To that end, I have been happy with my service there.  I also like the online bill payment system. It's clear and flexible with how I apply my payment. They are a step up from my previous provider.",

    "text": "I was asked to write the review here instead of under Roundpoint Mortgage Company  because even though they have the EXACT same physical address, website, and email domains...they are in fact not the same company...really?!?!?!  But ok i'll just leave this review up under BOTH sites.\n\nMy loan was transferred from a GREAT mortgage company to Roundpoint late last year.  Since then a NUMBER of problems have happened with my account.\n\n1) When my loan was first acquired i began to receive calls that i had not paid my last payment to my PREVIOUS mortgage company.  I told them I paid the last lender and that whatever is wrong needs to be worked out between my previous lender and roundpoint.  I received a call EVERYDAY for 3 weeks regarding this issue. Every person i spoke to would say they would make a note of my payments and check with my past loan provider.  No one ever called them.  I provided check numbers of the payment and transaction numbers, they still called.  Finally i called my previous lender myself, they told me ROUNDPOINT NEVER PAID FOR MY LOAN.  I was getting calls about a loan that they hadn't even funded completely.  How does something like this happen?\n\n2) Roundpoint begins telling me i don't have hazard insurance, which i most certainly did otherwise i wouldn't be able to have my house.  A week of phone battles between my insurance company and roundpoint and myself finally proved that i do in fact have hazard insurance and no one knows why i got the letter and calls.\n\n3) A month after that i needed roundpoint to pay my TX windstorm insurance as it is a REQUIREMENT for home ownership where i live.  My insurance company called several times and was told they were not able to escrow it. I called several times and was never able to talk to anyone in the escrow dept.  Every time i called i was sent to a new agent who would then put me back in the queue for the SAME dept.  Finally i called and was angry enough to actually get someone to put me directly in touch with the escrow department.  The lady i spoke to said that adding the insurance to the escrow account would be no problem and that they would pay my insurance company immediately.   Why did i have to go through a week of people telling me they can't do it when it only took 1 person in the correct dept. to say it could be easily done?\n\n4) This is the big one.  A new year has started and i wanted to check and see if roundpoint had updated my tax and insurance information for the new year.  They had not.  My insurance had dropped in premium price in October, they still had the old balance up.  I then asked the agent ot check and see if my taxes had been updated for 2014.  She said, they were using the SAME TAX INFORMATION FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR (is that legal to just reuse outdated data).  That's just lazy, no one had called my county tax collector to get updated information on my property, so they felt it would be OK to just use what i had last year regardless of if it went up or down.  God forbid it has gone up and i didn't check and i find out i have to come out of pocket at the end of the year to settle what my underfunded escrow account couldn't.\n\nI'm not sure if it's incompetence or just plain lazy but these mistakes seem to happen ALL the time.  You don't make it easy to speak to a representative, and when you do find one they have a tendency to say \"let me look into this and we'll call you back\" which NEVER happens.  When you call back, and tell them you called the day before they tell you they don't have a record of that or the person you spoke to.  It's frustrating to work with this company and if they could just sell my mortgage to b of a or somewhere i would be so happy.",

    "text": "Pretty poor excuse for a financial institution. On Friday at about 1pm, I went to this branch in to have money wire transferred to an account at a different bank.  \n\nWhen I was at the bank, the rep I was working with in one of the front cubicles had to go to the \"back office\" several times to check on things.  When I asked why it was taking so long (over 45 minutes) he advised that they want to make sure it had not gone through twice.  Friday evening I checked my account online and could see that my account had not been charged for the amount of the transfer and thus I knew it had not been successfully processed.\n\nSaturday morning I talked with the branch manager and she didn't have a clue.  Said there was some kind of a \"computer glitch\", that the transfer department was closed till Monday morning and that she'd follow up then.  A \"computer glitch\" at a bank?????  Wow, what a confidence builder that is.  Also, no call to me on Friday to let me know that there was a problem with processing the transfer so I could let the intended recipient know.  They knew they were having some issues while I was at the branch (\"making sure it didn't go through twice\") but yet no management initiative to ensure that was supposed to happen did actually happen.  Wow...another confidence builder!!!!\n\nTwo of the reps I have done transactions with at this location, Alex and Jose, have been excellent.  The third, who shall go unnamed, like his manager this morning on my call about the wire transfer, didn't have a clue.  The transaction that day was getting a Medallion stamp for a financial transaction.  For over an hour I sat in his cube while he was on the phone with someone who seemed to know less about the process than he did.  One of the two of them said they needed to see an account statement to \"prove ownership\".  It of course doesn't and the manager acknowledged that they needed to know the value of the account in order to issue the correct type of Medallion.  Who fabricated the BS about a simple account statement proving ownership is unknown and it doesn't matter nor should they be in a position of providing information to customers. \n\nSo, so far, 4 visits; two handled efficiently and two (wire transfer and Medallion stamp) were failures in the initial visits on each.  Even in the worst scenarios of grading on a curve, 50% is usually a failure grade.  And, that is what Chase has done: failed to perform.  With that abysmal performance, other than cashing a personal check, which is pretty hard for even Chase to screw up, it looks like I need to select a new financial institution for handling anything else.",

Then a few weeks later I get another bill with late penalties. After almost a month and several frustrating phone calls I was told a manager (Shamika) would listen to the recording of my original conversation and if the employee did in fact tell me not to worry about the supplemental tax bill that they would refund me the penalty. I was going to be called back in no more than 72 hours. This was over 2 weeks ago . I've tried calling multiple times  and she's always in a meeting, apparently with all of the other managers because they won't respond to me either. During this time they did my escrow analysis and sent me a check with my surplus and told me my supplemental tax bill had to be paid with that amount. After telling me that they STILL paid my first supplemental tax bill leaving my escrow in the negative, which increased my monthly payment. When I called about this, nobody could help me. I'm really really really disappointed in this company and I'm so frustrated that my head is going to explode. I'm helpless and don't know what to do at this point.",

They have no original note on the property and had their service hire an insurance assessment company break into our home and steal from us. After hiring an attorney to iron out the details, they said they were closing our file. We are still waiting for them to prove that they do, in fact, hold our mortgage. We have asked them to produce the original note to prove they own our mortgage. They do not return calls. They do not contact their customers directly..they will ignore all pleas for paperwork or proof. They were not licensed in the state in which our home exists..yet they claim to be the servicing agent? Our attorney has been calling them repeatedly but to no avail.

She conference called my wife to the customer service dept. this broad was rude from the get go, literally went off on the insurance person that was trying to help, she demanded that she hang up and let her deal with my wife. The lady couldn't because it disconnect my wife's call. Rude ass kept saying that she can just call back. Needed up demanding to speak with another supervisor named \"Marco\". So he gets on, she goes off, he's like \"really, you're doing this with a customer on the phone?\"\n\nBottom line is the people in that viper pit of a customer service office must get off on jerking people around and providing minimum service possible.\n\nI refuse to feed the beast that is roundpoint any longer.

The fact is this agent has a complete lack of understanding of listening and acknowledging issues that arise.\nSuch as incorrect information, my policy information being sent to someone that I had requested not be sent certain information. as well as incorrect information stated and the lack of taking responsibility. \nI recently received a call from the agent Mary advising me she had received my request to switch agents, which I sent much earlier on. The agent had taken a lengthy amount of time to transfer my policy, which I confirmed does not take much time to take place. Even after my policies where transferred to the new agent she or her office still failed to send everything over which caused a delay in obtaining a life insurance policy. Mary personally requested I remove my yelp page comment. I advised I would not. She explained that she feels its incorrect. I explained she can comment on my review as I have done for my own personal business. I advised her I felt it was very unethically for her to ask me to remove it. \nAt that point the conversation came to end.\nToday 10/13 I received an email from Yelp reference case 5065974 advising me they had removed my review of yelp because it had been brought to their attention by the yelp community that it fell outside of their content guidelines because it did not provide enough detail. It a little funny that someone had said that to yelp, after receiving a verbal request from Mary herself to remove it. I will pursue this unethical action further.",

I was recently in a car accident on a hot 115 degree day. I called mary's office and spoke with Heidi. I asked her to walk me through the process. She took general info from me and transferred me to some guy who said he couldn't help me and that my agent should have gone over the details of what I needed to do next. So I hang up and call Mary's office again. No answer. I call again. No answer. I call again ( please know it was 115 degrees outside and I had 2 small children with me). Heidi answered again but could not give me any information. She said she could not help me that I could talk to claims about the process. I asked what my deductible was, I asked if I had rental coverage, I asked if my car would be towed.... She said she could not help me and transferred me to the clowns department again who told me that since it was after 1pm on Saturday that would not get a rental car for me until Monday. Even though I have coverage for it. They also told me because of the time I would need to have my car towed at my expense and submit for reimbursement. Even though I have coverage for it. I had to call them back 4 more times that day asking additional questions and their response was we can help you on Monday during business hours. Very disappointed. 10 years of paying premiums and he first time I need to use them .... I was on my own.",

I like the upgrades to the ATM machines..no envelopes or deposit slips adding the cash deposit is awesome.  I missed that when I closed down my other checking account with a major bank 7 years ago. However, having to deposit checks one deposit at a time is cumbersome and annoyed me and the people behind me.",

I opened up my dollar store a little over a year ago and I am very pleased with how the business is performing and continuing to grow. \n\nI have over 30 years of retail experience and was ready to go out on my own. I did a tremendous amount of research, looking into franchises, buying an existing business and other opportunities before I decided to go with Dollar Store Services. I absolutely made the right choice! \n\nEvery person I encountered at DRSS was professional, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and eager to help. From the Real Estate Department to the Finance Department to the Merchandising Team, everyone did a great job of doing their part and ensuring I was satisfied and looking out for my best interests. Each phase was seamless. \n\nAfter they get your store set up and opened, they call you weeky to see how things are going and if there is anything they can help with. They also continue to be a resource for any concerns or questions you may have. This is not a give them their money company and never hear from them again. They continue to be involved and are available as needed in any aspect of the business. \n\nThe bottom line is, you are paying for a service, but you are in control of all decisions. You choose the location. DRSS negotiates the lease, but you have final approval or disapproval. You choose the layout of your store and the merchandise you receive. You create the business name and most importantly the business strategy/plan. You must own it and be involved to make your business successful.\n\nI am looking to open up more stores and will definitely be using Dollar Store Services as I grow and expand.",

    "text": "I've been open since Nov 2013 and DRSS really helped me through the process of finding a location, financing, my leasing contract, merchandising, ordering and building/setting up my store and many other things.  Unlike owning a franchise, I felt I had a say in every step of the process and at any point IF I wanted to I could've stopped and said No to anything I didn't like/agree with.  Some owners might not like having a merchandise package pre-set for their 1st order/opening but it's truly the best way.  No one knows based on your location what is gonna be hot or not.  Just because it's hot in many other locations it might not be the hot item for your store.  So after the initial opening, you have 100% freedom to re order an item or choose something different based on customer feedback.  This isn't a franchise, do what you want. There is no sure thing in anything you do.  I've learned for my particular store to have a small amount of an item but have lots of variety and it has been great for me.  Some vendors might not be so flexible with having smaller case sizes for what you want and we've learned that there are SO many choices/other vendors to order from out there that we typically end up much happier than getting stuck with lots of something that didn't end up selling.  DRSS is very helpful anytime I need to call and ask for advice with a product or vendor or a display or anything at all.  Remember it's advice, it's not a franchise, do what you want. Some things work out great, others don't. You really just have to keep talking to your customers and find out what is popular for your location.  I also HIGHLY recommend attending trade shows like toyfest and ASD here in Las Vegas (they are here twice a year).  This gives you a chance to meet with current and new vendors, touch and play with new merchandise that might interest you and you can do this on your own or a representative of DRSS can spend time with you to help you as well, it's totally your choice.  All I can end with is what you get out of your business depends on the effort you put into it. It doesn't run itself.  Thank you DRSS for what you've helped me with and the flexibility to do what I want with my own business.",

I've never had to wait more than a minute, and the staff always processes my transaction quickly.\n\nAt other locations I get frequently annoyed at how the staff forces small talk. They notice my out of state ID, etc. and start chatting me up. Look, I didn't come to the bank to make friends, I came here to cash a check, make a deposit, etc. I don't have that problem at this location however. The staff is kind and makes me feel welcome but they don't waste my time and I really appreciate that.\n\nThey have a drive thru, a drive thru ATM and an additional ATM inside. If you like Chase (which I do), this location is one worth visiting.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever in every way!!! I walk into an empty chase bank and I'm thinking that wow this is my lucky day, I'm walking into the bank and it is not busy, I should definitely be able to get in and out rather quickly. I walked up to a teller and let her know I needed to do a name change ...would that be through her or  or where did I go she informed me it would be with a personal banker and that I should have a seat and someone would be right with me as soon as they were done helping the guests they were assisting. \n\nOn a sidenote I had called customer service the day before to see if I can do the name change on the phone and they wanted me to come in person and were even kind enough to look up the closest location for me, which was the warm Springs and Durango location. The customer service rep on the phone let me know I should be able to walk in and get assistance no problem. \n\nAfter I sat there for 20 minutes on my lunch break one of the personal bankers freed up and walked right by me and welcomed someone else who had just sat down. I politely noted that I think I was next as I've been waiting, before they arrived. She rudely snapped her neck and looked at me and said wry rudely \n Um did you make an appointment? With her eyebrows raised and face scowled. I said no, no one informed me I needed to make an appointment and she said they were strictly by appointment only and I needed to come back when I had one. She then took her appointment to her cube. \n\nAt no time did anyone inform me that they were by appointment only and no one ever stepped out to say the wait is going to be awhile, or ask if I had an appointment, before letting me sit there twenty minutes. The teller told me to have a seat but never informed me of the policy either. \n\nI left upset and the started to become very upset and frustrated because I was just rudely talked down to and asked to leave after waiting a long time. I walked right back in walked and interrupted her with her clients and said you need to get a manager, I'm not gonna be refuse service and treated poorly and she told me her manager was busy and there was no one here to help me. I started yelling that I wanted her manager now. She went behind close doors and said it's going to be at least 15 minutes if I wanted to wait because she's busy.\n\nSo I waited and while I waited I called customer care and filed a complaint, they offered to call the branch and get someone to help me. I accepted, just shortly after they rang a person in a black suit came and called me by name and let me know she was taking me to someone who could help. She walked me to the business transaction line where the clerk had ultimate \"bitch face\" and asked what can I help you with rudely, I stared a simple name change while on the verge of tears. She said no I can't do that, you need an appointment, you will have to come back. I said really? Does the left hand not know what the right hand is doing I was just told I would be assisted and you are telling me no, come back when I have an appointment? Seriously? She said I can't help you, next in line please!!!! \n\nI walked out yelling that they cannot expect to keep customers being so rude and denying service and that they just lost all my business. You don't get to treat people with disrespect and yank them around for an hour it ended up being without providing any service or utility and basically ignoring me entirely even while I'm frustrated and upset. No one felt the urge to pull me aside or calm me down just to keep fueling the fire and treating me poorly. I am never going back to this location and I'll be damned if I need to bank with them there are too many places who actually enjoy their job and want to treat people kindly and not waste their time.",

The best part about getting insurance with Chelsea is that she educates you about what your insurance options are and what the best way is to get a better rate.  Not many businesses today care enough to do that.  You can overpay or underpay and not be insured correctly when buying insurance- Chelsea really pays attention and knows her stuff!

Sitting first at the stoplight I was lucky this situation was not worse. Whiplash, back issues and almost $15K in damage...this situation was bad enough. \n\nMy nice new car was completely smashed. Back hatch, back hatch shell, back bumper, all sensors and components under bumper, right taillight, right back quarter, right back door, bent roof shell, and labor and paint...a total nightmare. \n\nCalled the claim in to Progressive (we both have had them over ten+ years) a few hours later and we drove the bumper flying off smashed end car to the center the next day. Let's get this done.\n\nPre Drop Off: As a diamond customer they offered to come pick up the car and take it to the shop we wanted to use but I just wanted hubby to get the rental for me and get this deal over with. Hurt and in a wrist splint I wanted this process over (again) ASAP. \n\nDrop off: We arrived to a beautiful smiling face (can't remember her name) Hubby gave them the keys. Signed some papers. She explained accident forgiveness. She said she felt sooo bad for me and I must have been in pain, yes I was in major pain, empathy nice. Done. She/they would call when it was ready. \nWe were offered water, snacks, blah blah, everything but a massage. The transaction was soo fast we didn't even have a minute to check it out, which is awesome. \n\nRental: They actually put my car in the body shop I wanted it in and the rental was a brand new 1400 mile spotless one. Hundyai GT something. Cute, black, brand new and clean (thank goodness no smells) but I drove it three times maybe? over the week and a half. \n\nPickup: We drove the rental back put the $4 in gas in it across the street, pulled in and was greeted with a smiling face again. The guy took hubbys card for the deductible then the rep he took us outside to my baby.\nIt looks like it just drove off the showroom floor...again.\n\nNeedless to say it was a very smooth transaction. Hey that's what insurance is for right? It blows my car baby was rear ended again. The person who did this can eat a big one (karma is a bitch)...but with this insurance and excellent customer service...hey it could have been way freaking worse!",

Be persistent that they come to the scene and fill out a report even if nothing really happened. A lot of time and energy could have been saved by waiting for the police.

She set up my estimate meeting according to my availability and convenience. \n\nGoing in for the estimate was simple, easy and painless. As indicated it took approximately 45 minutes. I waited in the lobby that had very comfortable couches and chairs. There is also a snack area that had a variety of snacks: Oreos, goldfish, cookies and chips. There are refrigerators that contain water and sodas and a tea and coffee maker. The snack area was a nice touch. While waiting for my estimate was able to do a little bit of work and answer emails. Leaving I was able to set up my appointment to drop off my vehicle for repairs.\n\nHopefully the repair process is just as easy.

    "text": "Paragon was referred to us by a lender that my husband and I trusted so little research was done on their services prior to working with them. Bari Clapick was the original person we spoke to there and she was very nice and very persistent in getting us signed up, but as soon as they took our money there was rarely any follow up. We gave about $2k with no positive results. After a lot of self research I managed to get my credit to where we needed it to be to get our house, about a week away from closing Mark Hagenbart the supposed CEO and owner calls me and says he is going to send us to collections and file a judgement (this is after we were done paying him) His exact words to me were \"I don't care if you get into a house, you're the most egregious person I've ever done business with and I don't care about your family.\" Scared out of my mind that we wouldn't get into our house, I paid him about $800 over the phone for services I never received because we didn't want to lose the house. Never got a receipt and never heard anything from him again. Needless to say it was definitely our fault for not doing the research and trusting a lender who we ended up not using. There are sooooo many ways to improve your credit by just self educating yourself and working with a lender who's company has an in house credit specialist. These credit \"repair\" companies are a scam, they just send out disputes on everything and in turn just prolong the home buying process.",

To add insult to injury, they said that they didn't have any notes on file that I have called previously; I have called and spoken to them no fewer than 6 times.\n\nEdit: I spoke to Jose who was the first helpful - not defensive and argumentative - person I've encountered.

They do more than just suck. They are the worst. \n\nI had a doctors visit at which I had some\n\"routine\" and \"preventive\" tests done after expressing to my doctor that I had no concerns. She informed me that these tests were preventive and therefore covered by my Health Net plan. A few months later- surprise! I get a bill from the lab for the tests.  I called health net to ask why I was being charged, and they blamed the doctors office for incorrect codes. After finding out that this wasn't the case I called back, and was given more inaccurate and useless information. After calling AGAIN I was told by a higher-up that I shouldn't have been charged and they would reprocess my claim. Over the next month I called to check in on the status of the claim multiple times, and was told it was \"being processed.\" Then after the supposed 30 business days required for reprocessing I called and was told that NO ONE HAD EVER SENT THE CLAIM BACK!!\n\nI have talked to at least 10 people from health net, NONE of which were competent enough to resolve my problem, and now I am paying for services I never even needed that should have been covered by the insurance to avoid collections.

I had to call because I had never heard of the doctor listed as my PCP, I got the information corrected and they mailed me new cards.\nNow for the Health Net BLUNDER: They also issued member ID cards to former subscribers giving them new ID numbers as well and indicating they were all active members as of 1/1/13. You can imagine how shocked we were to get a Health Net member card for my husband who has not had Health Net insurance for nearly 3 years. We called Health Net and they confirmed that this was an error that impacted thousands of AZ residents who were former subscribers and that in fact my husband does not have Health Net insurance and the card was issued by mistake. \nFine, issue resolved? Nooooooo--they had already filed all of these former subscribers as covered by Health Net in a national database and now his Humana insurance refuses to pay any of his medical bills claiming that Health Net has to pay first! Of course we are going through the hassle of appealing these rejections, but this was all preventable if Health Net had not made this egregious error.\n\nAVOID HEALTH NET OF AZ!

Hours spent on the phone eventually lead to payment months later. On the last day of February 2015 Health Net cancelled in error my company group health policy but did not notify anyone until April 7th.  Health Net claims they reinstated the policy back to March 1st but I am waiting to see if this is true. Today my wife called to make an appointment with our eye doctor who has been a Health Net MD for many years. My wife was told Health Net without explanation dropped his practice from their provider list. Health Net seems to have high employee turnover and a reputation for poor service. Stay Away.",

When you try to contact tech support via email they send you an email back telling you to click on a link for secure messages, but the link doesn't work!  (just one example of the cr*p that goes on with them).  They do not pay claims and deny all sorts of things that you're supposed to get.  For example, I am supposed to pay $50 for a visit to Urgent Care.  So far, for one visit I have paid $70, and am now being billed another $50.  The Urgent Care people tell me it's because HealthNet refuses to pay.  I have been trying to call HealthNet for over a week.  When, after holding on for over 30 minutes I actually get through to a person, they tell me they have to transfer me to claims.  I ask for a direct number to claims, and they tell me there is none.  So then you are holding for another 30 minutes and you wind up reaching claims in another STATE!!!!  So they have to transfer you back to Arizona!!!  So far I have been holding on waiting to get back to where I started from for over an HOUR!!!!!  This same scenario happened yesterday, and after holding for over an hour I was CUT OFF!!!  If this were not so important to me, I would say this company is a JOKE, but they are not a joke, they are a despicable corporation that will do anything to avoid paying your claims and then will not allow you to reach anyone about the claims to even find out why.

They have updated their online bill paying system and now it won't accept any form of payment.  This means I now have to call in, and wait on hold, each month just to pay my premium.  \n\nAfter multiple phone calls with multiple departments, I actually got an honest employee who told me that there isn't anyone who can help me to solve this problem.  I give her full credit for being honest.  That being said, it doesn't change the fact that their online bill paying system is useless.  I now have to wait on hold once per month to pay a premium that doesn't really cover anything.  \n\nAs previously mentioned, we will be changing insurance companies at year end. I recommend that anyone consider using Health net as your provider that you should consider poking your eyeballs out with dull, rusty needles first as it will be much less painful than actually dealing with this company.\n\nThe culture of 'customer last, payments first' pretty much says it all.

I called Health net they said oh it's just a mistake have your employer just resubmit your forms . so my employer and i both resubmit the forms that i had originally submitted with all the dates cause i kept them . and they still denied my children coverage. so thank you health net for collecting $8500 of my dollars and providing NO  coverage. you are criminals. I'm not understanding why you can take money and promise a service and then not have to provide any services and not go to jail. You steel from people.

I also drive a super safe vehicle that's not a drag racer car. It was also not financed. So I should most definitely get all the discount benefits being so low risk. However, I couldn't believe how ridiculously high all the quotes I got were. And I am in Nevada now? I'm talking about, ALL the quotes I got were double the cost of what I was paying in Cali and at that, these policies were bare minimum coverage. Before I had full coverage and low deductibles (I had Mercury / Progressive). And even a new quote from them was exactly the same, double the cost, less than half the coverage. \n\nThen I found Geico. I'll just leave it at that. I have had them this whole year. And then this month I sold my car and bought a Scooter (for the interim). It's kind of tricky, b/c these kinds of Scooters don't have VIN #s, aren't registered etc. So after I signed up for this new policy online, I called the Geico office just to clarify these things. The service there was immediate. I had a specialist on the line with me within minutes. And I was covered immediately. Huh, $25 bucks a month on this new policy!! Really friendly, helpful staff. And I feel totally confident in their service. \n\nLast but not least, I have seen that Geico's offerings as far as discounts (for certain things that make you lower risk) was the best fit for me! Other companies had some of the discounts for me, Geico had all the discounts that I wanted / deserved to benefit from (in the overall cost of the policy). \n\nWhen I go buy my next car, (assuming nothing changes w/Geigo and I don't expect it will), I will definitely stay with Geico then too.",

They get you in with a low rates and then raise your rates no matter what.

    "text": "I've been a Chase customer for 10 years. A lot of that has to do with the fact that it's such a pain in the butt to change everything over to another bank and some of it has to do with the fact that there's really no huge significant difference between one bank and another. For the most part I'm satisfied with the services Chase offers.\n\nThis review is branch specific and \"customer service\" specific. Ironically, banks seem to be getting rid of employees, (those responsible for \"customer service\"), and making everything automated and self-service. But there are a few employees left to man the shop, mostly managers and someone to point customers to the proper self-service machine; the banking industry equivalent to a Walmart Greeter. The few employees left to hold down the fort at this particular branch are always rude. Now in all fairness, I don't go to this branch that often and when I do, 9 times out of 10 I use the drive-thru ATM. I rarely go inside, but on the few occasions I have gone inside my impression was \"rude.\" I don't believe I've ever dealt with the same employee twice there, so maybe \"rude\" is part of the hiring criteria for this branch. \n\nYesterday I called the branch after my wife told me about the \"rude\" treatment she received from someone there when trying to resolve an issue. When I called I immediately asked to speak to a manager and got the obligatory, \"Okay, tell me what the problem is and maybe I can help.\" The first problem is that I called in as a customer and asked to speak to a manager and you immediately took the [customer is always wrong] approach and ignored my request. You might as well have said, \"Okay, you're obviously an idiot and there's no way you could possibly know if you need to speak to a manager or not - you need ME to make that determination for you.\" \n\nAfter I explained why I was calling she put me on hold for a substantial time. Finally another women picked up and her English was so bad it was annoyingly difficult to understand her. I asked, \"Are you a manager?\" and she replied something like, \"No, there no are any managers who can available.\" (That's not an exact quote - but it's close). \n\nSince there's really nothing but managers working there now I'm guessing I got handed off to the cleaning lady or someone of equal authority. At any rate, she couldn't do anything for me except to continually say, \"I'm sorry, unfortunately... I'm sorry, unfortunately... I'm sorry, unfortunately...\" The ole \"condescending, I'm not going to do anything for you, why are you trying to make me work\" approach to customer service - gotta love it.\n\nIf it wasn't such a pain in the butt to switch banks I probably would, but then I'd probably just have to put up with this kind of incompetence by some lazy employee who used to work for Chase.",

This doesn't bother everyone, but I travel a lot.\n\nThey once tried to charge me 5$ for a printout of my statement.  Apparently it was a miscommunication, and they thought I wanted some official document rather than a standard printout.

This is entirely subjective, but part of the reason I joined was a positive experience with a small bank elsewhere.  People there knew me and were friendly.  The representatives were hit or miss at Canyon State, some very pleasant and others perfunctory.\n\nIt's not so much that they don't work, but rather, that they are mediocre in all of the areas that I value as a checking account holder.

This location is always understaffed, if two tellers are there its a full house. The tellers are always positive and helpful ( Alberto and Gabriella come to mind), however, today I meet the new branch manager Kay Handy ( or Hardy). She was extremely passive aggressive and borderline rude. I had visited the branch earlier today and waited for about 20 minutes in line before I left. I came back 2.5 hours later and facing another long line ( another 25 minutes) stayed. Once I got up to the only teller ( in training) working and Kay, I asked to make a cash deposit. It took some time to verify the cash and some other bank patrons decided to spend their time elsewhere and get out of line, just like I did earlier. \n\nHere is my point. I am not responsible for your staffing levels. I am not responsible for what other patrons do in line. Everyone has to wait at the bank. I understand you were under stress training a new to the state employee but if you have a problem with your Locations Time To Provide Service then call in another employee or shut the doors and don't do business until you can meet your own standards.

The bankers and tellers I have interacted with at other Chase Bank branches across the US from Denver, NYC to Lexington, Ky have been incredibly helpful and expeditious when assisting me. And the drive thru tellers are usually kind at this branch. \n\nHowever, today, I sat for 30 minutes, with a grumpy toddler, waiting to be helped. And there I sat, with only one person acknowledging me. She offered my child a lollipop and kindly informed me she had an appointment with a client or she would have been happy to help me, until I decided to leave. \n\nNot one person, after the friendly banker, popped over to say that they were going to take a while with their current client or gave me an approximate wait time. I even approached a teller who had no customers in line, to inform them that a fellow customer and I both needed help and that we had been waiting for some time. After a quick apology from the teller and my returning to the waiting area, still no one assisted us. There was no sense of urgency from the employees.\n\nIn short, it was a very disappointing customer service experience. After a meltdown from my toddler and 30 minutes of total waiting, I needed to leave and so I did. Without an acknowledgment of my presence or of my leaving. \n\nI bank with this branch only because it's conveniently close to my home. But, from now on, unless absolutely necessary, will I go into the lobby to be assisted.",

I always get the feeling they think they are doing me a big favor when I come in.  Recently I was in the market for a home mortgage and was treated like a total loser. Mr Bill B, mortgage banker acted like he was always pissed off at the world.  Even tried and talk to this guys boss and still was totally treated like trash. I finally told them to just forget about it and took my business across the street to Wells Fargo where I was actually treated like a human being.  Next step will be to close all accounts at Chase.

However, time has passed, and as we have become frequent users of this Chase location, my fear has subsided. The tellers are always smiling, and they know us by name. They even take the time to get to know a bit more about us. Yes, ultimately, it is the arm of a big, bad banking megacorporation, but they manage to make the experience feel a bit more personal.

I couldn't deposit money in the account manually because they cut off the relationship with UPS where I deposited up till then.  They charged me an over draft of 25 bucks.  There was a total due of 28 bucks and change.  I would have been happy to pay it but they cant take Visa and I cant deposit via UPS.  The only option was electronic deposit via internet. They have every legal right to have charged my account off for 3 bucks but do veterans really want to deal with it,  It dropped my credit score over 100 points.  \n\nMy suggestion to you is don't use them.  Its a pain in the back side to deposit and there is no relationship.  it all about the money.  They screwed me over 3 bucks.  Imagine what they will do to you.  Insurance yes....  Banking no.

    "text": "SHORT STORY: Julie is impolite, unprofessional, and a LIAR. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS.\n\nLONG STORY: For the 2014 tax returns, my mother (who filed me as her dependant) went through Julie. Since I am no longer her dependant and have a family of my own, I decided to file my 2015 taxes with TurboTax. I encountered a problem when I tried e-filing, as I couldn't do so without the address that was used. I was unsure if my mother used my address or hers to file my taxes. I thought, no problem, I'll just call Julie and ask for the address. Apparently that was a problem. I called her, left a message, and over a week went by without a return phone call. \n\nI tried recalling her and I immediately felt as if she saw my phone call as a burden. She was not polite in any way, and as soon as she gave me the address she said \"okay, bye\" and hung up. I had another question, as the IRS website was not processing the address to give me an e-filing PIN, and had she waited half a second I would have asked for my AGI, However, she did not. She hung up on me. I waited a few minutes to call her back, and she ignored my call. I thought, \"okay, maybe she's on the other line.\" so I waited another hour and a half to recall her. Again, to voicemail I went. I left her another message this time, politely asking if I might be able to get my AGI. I then sent my mother a message to ask if she had that on file, and explained to her what had just happened. After a few minutes, my mother returned my phone call. \n\nTHIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING. She told me she just called Julie, who told her that she was tired of giving me the information, had spoken to me on several occasions, is very annoyed at this point and will send my tax information if I pay $25 for it. While I understand wanting to get paid for your time, there was ABSOLUTELY no reason to lie. None whatsoever. It would have been completely fine if she has said \"I've been a bit busy, so I hadn't had the chance to pick up her call. I apologize for that. However, I do not want to work for free, so I can send her all the documents via email for $25\" That would have been very professional, BUT NO. She thought it would be best to make it out like we have spoken on numerous occasions and isn't answering because I am practically harassing her when we had only spoken once after me waiting over a week for a return call, just so she didn't look rude to my mother, her client. Biggest load of crap.",

But I've had a number of screw-ups originating here that would make me never trust this bank for anything beyond that. \n\n(1) After another PNC branch screwed up a transfer by failing to submit it, I re-did it here (taking an hour of my time). I was told the fee would be waived because PNC had wasted my time; it wasn't and nobody bothered to inform me about the outcome or why it the fee-waiver was denied. (2) When clearing out my account via wire-transfer, the person failed to include the wire-transfer fee either via cash or by taking out the proper amount (balance - the fee). This left me in the red and forced me to take my own time to go in (while attempting to move out of the city) and fix the issue. \n\nIn each case, a torrent of apologies ensue from everyone involved. But at some point, I don't care about apologies -- I just want a bank that works, and when a bank screws up, for it to not charge me for botched work.",

Leider sind meist nur einige (maximal 5) davon besetzt.

While legally, they did nothing wrong, it cost us money and in our view was very unethical and immoral. Terry Turk and Todd Rogers both refused to make it right.  \n\nIt really boiled down to their rejecting our suggestion to make the loan go through.  Then when they couldn't get it done, (as Todd Rogers said \"we have nothing to lose now so why not\") they took our suggestion and the extra charges were born by us not them.  Using our suggestion, the loan did go through.  WE DID THEIR JOB FOR THEM!!!!  It cost us extra money that wouldn't have been the case if they had just taken our suggestion in the first place.  Really unfair!  They didn't step up and admit they were wrong and offer to pay the extra charges.\n\nWe gave the next 30 loans to another lender Ferrell Beazer of at the time Express One Mortgage. We were real estate investors at the time that knew what was required.  The supposed professionals did not and it cost us money.\n\nSuggestion:  Try someone else and save some money.  We thought by now for sure they would be out of business.  It's surprising they are still in business?",

I had no choice become a customer of these crooks because they bought my home loan from another company. I had no say in the matter. If I had a choice, Chase bank would be my very last choice. I feel much more like a victim of this horrible company than a customer. Their app is terrible and doesn't work right, so they reward themselves for it handsomely with a healthy late fee for themselves. Now, they make me pay my mortgage with a cashier check or cash only, because when they went to \"reward\" themselves with some of my hard earned money for their gross incompetence, my bank USAA, best bank in the world, denied them. I can't express how much I hate dealing with these guys, and they stand by their lack of empathy and poor customer service. They truly don't care, they make their money off of late fees and tricky practices. If you're thinking of banking with Chase, just don't, they truly suck. You'll wish you didn't. There's a Desert Schools credit union across the street, and they are a much better choice, I have them also, and they are great.",

Hooray for Credit Unions!\n\nCompared to other Credit Unions I've done business with, CMCU holds up pretty well. They absolutely excel in customer service - they hire smart, happy people who put out positive vibes and treat you like you're special. Honestly, most CUs have this nailed - it's an essential part of the experience, obviously - so ya.\n\nThey're growing - there are now 6 locations in Charlotte. \n\nAnyone that lives, works, or goes to school in Charlotte can join - which means anyone in our fair city who wants to opt out of the big bank BS can jump on the CU bandwagon. Although this is a growing trend among CUs, many still serve specific populations (ie, state workers, telecommunications employees, etc) and their families, so it's rad that CLT has a Credit Union that will work with anyone in the area.\n\nBut - c'mon, you knew it was coming - CMCU's not perfect. Dings include:\n\nBroken or empty ATM's at peak hours (broken) and Sundays (empty). Only worth mentioning because of the frequency at which these things occur.\n\nOutdated technology at the ATMs (if you need to check balances, make transfers, and withdrawal money, you'll be sticking your card in and keying your code three times). Website's a tad slow and anti-intuitive. But, they do electronic statements, so that's helpful.\n\nATM withdrawals are limited to 4 per month before they start assigning fees. Yeah, that's pretty lame. Getting cash back from a store purchase won't cost you or count.\n\nConservative lending practices and membership approval goes with the territory at CUs, so expect a pretty thorough financial check-up before becoming part of the Union.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty comfy with CMCU and plan on continuing to be a customer. However, if I had access to other more \"exclusive\" CUs, I'd probably do some exploring.",

I joined today after my friend recommended I check them out, as I was feeling uneasy about the interest rate I secured for a car. Ashley and Martha at the Ashley Road location were wonderfully helpful, customer-oriented, and were able to cut the other rate in a bit more than half. The level of service, competitiveness of rates and ease of communication is genuinely outstanding. I now intend on making Charlotte Metro my primary financial institution for not only major lending activities, but daily banking as well because of this excellent experience. As  a side note to the review discussing \"shady\" practices in reference to overdraft fees, the CU gives you the option when you open the account to not permit any payments to clear your account (i.e., decline attempted charges) if it will cause an overdraft to ensure no fee can occur.

    "text": "Things started off pretty good at this credit union, until I realized they're so much like a bank they should just call themselves one! I initially opened an account with CMCU because they had better auto loan rates than other comparable financial institutions. To get that rate, I was forced to open- and keep open- a savings account with a minimum $25.00/balance. After dealing with over a year of medical illness and hospitalizations, I fell behind on that loan. I made prior arrangements to pay my auto loan (which I had never been late with before) on such a date and in the amount of xyz, and without so much as a notification from CMCU, when I got a sum of money deposited into my checking account from a relative trying to help out (but had plans on using it for groceries and other necessities), Charlotte Metro went ahead and helped themselves to MY MONEY to get me caught back up on the loan, when I had already made plans to pay the auto loan with an advisor from their loan department. Without that immediate cash, I was unable to buy groceries for my daughter and pet food for my two small dogs, let alone gas to get to work or food for myself. I'm sorry, but putting food into my 3-year-old's mouth is, and will always be, more important than a less-than-30-day delinquent auto payment. I've never heard of any financial institution going into an account (even if they see the money is there) and simply helping themselves to it! Not only did Charlotte Metro do this once, but TWICE! You would think I would have learned my lesson during that first struggle/hardship that they caused me, but unfortunately it took me twice to learn. Never again! Readers, beware!",

I had the card shut down and a new card number was issued.  Their credit card is  with a bank in \nNebraska, and I found out today that their bill pay system is outsourced to Virginia.  They are starting their own credit card next month but I was told that if I want to switch to that one I will have to go through the entire new customer application process.  This will really hurt my credit score if I close down the first account and do this.  Every penny I own is in this credit union, and I am upset that they could not just transfer me from the card THEY set me up with to their new local card service (there is 0 balance and were never any late payments.).  I am also having an issue with this Omaha bank because I paid the balance with my online CMCU bill pay and they say they didn't receive it.  The money was deducted from my account and hopefully this is just a small glitch that will be straightened out.  But I thought the main point of a credit union as opposed to a bank was that everything is handled locally. That would have avoided some of my problem.   With all this outsourcing I am questioning if I'd do better to switch back to a local bank.",

On numerous occasions, Jerry helped me (we were in training together- yes, I worked for the credit union, for a brief time.) and was very nice (I don't know if he recognized me the last few times though but maybe it was a  busy time).\n\nThe two times that I went into the branch: it was clean, and there were only a few other members, so I didn't wait too long to get to the window. I was treated courteously. The members seemed to be the more mature set, which was good, because I used to see some strange members at the other branches (if you used to work with me, you know what I am talking about!). There was a coin machine but I think that they did away with that.",

I was going to pay off my loan and my credit card from your bank.   I can understand putting a hold on it until it clears, but to flat out refuse to take my money to pay you off is downright ridiculous!

I had a couple overdrafts back when when I first opened my account and it was a smooth process to resolve.

    "text": "First off Danielle  that place you parked is only for Chase employees and you do not get charged you have to have a badge to even park in the garage. Also, that Chase is a place that is a call center and there is a Chase bank right by CVS , ( you cant miss it ). And  your BF should not have had to climb any walls becuse there are several pedestrian walkway right into the employee garage. So maybe don't blame Chase for you not reading the signs posted EMPLOYEE PARKING GARAGE. Also one more thing,  you cannot get past  the security in the lobby. I have been a member when it was Washington Mutual, which I loved. FYI, Chase puts their employees through weeks of training and are very careful in safeguarding your accounts. Actually people get all uptight because they are so good about account security and idiots like a BF or a GF that have lived together or has children together or a son helping his elderly mom pay bills cannot coax  an Chase employee to give them access to anyones account if the cannot answer security ?'s and have access . So being a customer of some shady banks thrughout Phoenix, California, and Utah,  that will give information out randomly or half the time their shared branching system is down. and many other annoyances. I give Chase 3 stars only because I know employees that work over in that Tempe call center off of Mill, and they are micro managed to the point that the employees are miserable and stressed out  . Then when an employee wants to take vacations they must stay employed the full year even though they have plenty of time to use, or if they quit lets say before Dec 31 then stupid Chase sends them a bill. So lets just say they dont treat their employees well. So Chase in Tempe with the big sign (call center)  stop being douche bags to your employees that get yelled at by all the customers all day    . Maybe have those big managers and leads take classes on how to treat people and work as a team with better insentives than a stupid chase buck now and then. Because Wells Fargo pays more and advances their employees quicker without the bully method. Also Wells is on the Top with higher scores as of today.  No I am not a customer with Wells and at Chase I only have a savings. But the inside people that share their thoughts, do not like how you treat them. Other than poor power trip managers and Vacation hours being manipulated so you can never quit without being screwed then they are a good bank.",

Catch is, you have to pay $19 for some checks that nobody really uses in this time in age. I wasn't even going to continuing GIVING THEM MY BUSINESS considering they are a small BRANCH but I went along anyway & opened an account I now regret. \n\nFirst of, I was told since I opt for online statements I wouldn't get charged a fee.

I called TCF Bank about 4 times within 2 months of being a new customer and each time got lied to with them saying they were going to stop charging me the fee & reimburse me, never did. \n\nThen, I receive so much JUNK Advertisement mail that, WHO REALLY sits & read their mail from a corporation from a BANK? Well, I don't & I didn't so because of that TCF closed my account. \n\nI called again, 5X, was told that because of the Terrorist Act of the PATRIOT ACT that because I didn''t respond back to their mandatory questionnaire, they were acting illegally because they could not verify my residence & because of that closed the account.

However what they don't tell you is the operate on midwestern hours so when you bank after 3pm local time things are posted as being done the next business day.  \nThe issue I have is I saw my account was in overdraft and raced to cover it before the close of the local business day. However I was informed I would still be charged the $37 OD fee on a couple of dollars mishap.   I thought at a previous occassion that the amount was $5 or under I would not be hit with an OD fee for any bank but learned that was not the case with this bank.\nToday I discovered my mgmt company hacked my account to collect a $25 fee I refused to pay.  I have never paid them with bill pay. I have only hand writtenb a check or paid with a money order. TCF refuses to accept these facts and wants me to pay $32 stop payment or to allow the bill pay check to go through and then dispute it.  As I told them I am not working and $25 can create a nightmare of OD fees for me in the meantime.  \nMy only resort is to close the account.  Cancel the legitmate bill pays I have in que and to pay my bills via a different bank account, MO or cash.  And to eat the cost of the checks I ordered when opening the account barely 6 months ago.  Along with the 3 unfair OD fees for accounting errors I tried to correct in the 1st 24 hours of noticing them.\nThe staff is not friendly at this location andeveryone claims their hands are tied buy bank policy or the time difference when I have an issue.\nAlso please note I can seldom get the online statements to open!

    "text": "Beware of this insurance company!!!\n \nWe have been a customer of this insurance agent for a year, paying our premiums on time every month without incident. We recently moved our facilities in September and in doing so we needed to update our new location, loss payee info, and our new credit card information.  I contacted their company in mid-September.   I gave all of my updated information including my new credit card information and was assured by the office manager Roxana that the new certificate with the updated endorsements would be sent to me via email within 1 to 2 days.  They also took my updated credit card information over the phone.  She assured me that if there were any problems they would call.  I did not hear from them so I assumed that everything was ok.  They have called me in the past if there were any problems when we first started the policy and since there was no calls or emails, which were the primary forms of communication that we were engaged in during the updates as well when I first started the policy, I assumed that everything was in order.  We had a water main break at our office building a few units down from ours at the start of December.  It did some damage to some of our equipment and office furnishings.  I called them to file a claim.  They gave me the number to the claims department.  Almost a week has gone by and I finally received a call from the claims agent stating that they canceled my policy for non-payment back in October.  I called this agent and they said that after trying to run my business debit card, which had well enough to cover the premium, that they sent out a letter of cancelation instead of picking up the phone and calling or emailing me as they have done with all of our communication in the past!  If you take credit card information over the phone and you are not running the charge immediately, any normal person would consider, if the card is not going through ,that they may have made a mistake in writing down the information in the first place. Especially if it is a customer that has always paid on time for an entire previous year.  Why would you send a cancelation notice when you could simply pick up the phone and verify that the numbers that were written down were correct?  Why would your resort to this informal way to reach out to a good customer?  I question whether this insurance agent cares about truly helping protect YOUR BUSINESS.  When I called to get an explanation, Agent Fred was very cold and rude unlike how he was when trying to sell me the policy.  My suggestion would be to go elsewhere for your insurance needs.  This guy really doesn't seem to care about the health, welfare, or protection of any business but his own!",

They get two stars only because they did get me the Nevada Home Is Possible grant and they closed in a reasonable time.   However, the loan officer I worked with was very demeaning, i couldn't get any type of interest rate quote or lock in until I was actually under contract (which in the past I always was locked in), etc. Plus their rate was 4.25 while others were 3.50/3.75.   At one point I almost went thru Quicken Loans but, again, the Home is Possible Grant kept me tied to Freedom Mortgage.  If I heard it once, I heard it at least 20 times how great of a loan officer he was.   I had to bite my tongue and listen to his condescending voice.   I made my realtor deal with him most of the time.   So I closed and thought, it's done.   \n\nA month later I refinanced (I had to take a 5% rate for the grant) to get at 3.63 rate which lowered by payments by $200.   Two weeks before I was closing I was notified that Freedom had sold my mortgage.  They gave us a payoff good thru July 31.  We wired the money 7/29.  That should have been the end of it.  NOPE.  They transferred the loan to US Bank on 8/1.   It's been a nightmare to try and get fixed.  So now I have two mortgages on my credit report.   After two weeks of this Freedom FINALLY returned the money to the title company who is working with US bank to get this paid off.  \n\nas I said above, I would never recommend Freedom Mortgage to anyone I cared about.\n\n8/26 Update:  The nightmare continues with Freedom Mortgage who has admitted they shouldn't have transferred the loan on 8/1.   US Bank won't backdate the payoff and are requiring an additional $848 in interest.   I'm now getting past due notices from US Bank.   I'm to the point I'll have to pay the interest to protect my credit and then file a small claims with Freedom Mortgage.   NEVER will I recommend this company.  Next step is file a claim with BBB.",

She was on board and supported me fully. She also bragged about how she always kept up with clients and would get things done in a timely fashion. Boy, was that off.\n\nAt our first meeting, she and her assistant took my information, informed me of the next steps, etc. I left confident feeling as though she had my back. One week went by, two weeks went by, 3 weeks went by, nothing. Not knowing much about how all this works, I tried to call to see what I could find out. You know? Get an update, a further explanation of what was to happen. No answer. I called again and still no answer. I expected she was busy, so waited a little longer. I called again and she told me that she was busy with a client and that she would contact me later. She never did. Another week went by, every call went without answer. Until finally, she answered saying that her assistant could help me and I should email her for specifics. I didn't have her assistant's contact info and asked for it, which she said she'd give me later but she never did. I got tired of my calls not getting answered and sent her a text. She informed me that her assistant gave birth and she was handling everyone by herself. I understand that it's a lot of work, but you saw this coming for 9 months? Why didn't you plan for this. Besides, a month and a half later and you have no clue of me or my stuff?\n\nAfter that and all her excuses, I gave up. Samira ran my credit for the loan and led me on to believe she was doing something when she wasn't doing anything. I don't appreciate how she stringed me along saying all these good things when none of them happened. Thanks for the points on my credit. Thanks for wasting my time. Hopefully Freedom Mortgage has better brokers than Samira for the sake of clients that want things done.",

Now HSBC are onto that, and have a 'passport' account that uses your native country bank account as proof of who you are and where you come from. All well and good, but now comes the good bit. Don't get sucked into setting up your account at the HSBC branch on Princes Street. Hidden away down Hanover street is the Business branch, who also deal with regular customers like you and me. This branch actually has real people, who meet you at the door, take your details, and send you off to an office where you are seated and treated like a real person. Perchance there is a short wait involved, help yourself to a complimentary cup of brewed coffee, take a seat in a leather lounge, brows the foreign papers or catch up on the latest sports news on the wide screen TV.

Their team always kept us informed and were able to overcome some last second hiccups from the PMI company.\nWe got a great rate on our loan and closed on time without any issues.

How wonderful!  It was fast easy and very few questions asked. \nBut the good things stopped there. I was put on a weekly payment plan of $125 every Monday for 23 weeks for a total of about $2800. I was loaned $800 on a car with a blue book value of $2300 and agreed to pay $2800 total. Maybe I'm the moron here but when in a bind I had no other options. So anyhow I pay my weekly payments for 8 weeks in person at the office cuz that was part of the agreement.  The ninth week I went down to pay it and the office was closed due to it being a holiday. No big deal I thought, Ill just come back Tuesday morning. WRONG! I got up Tuesday late morning and my fricken car was gone!! Thinking it was stolen I called police and insurance company, etc. Come to find out the jerks at Cash Time took it. Apparently I had a 0 day grace period and as they said when I called \"it's not their problem I defaulted the agreement.\"  They wanted me to pay  $1600 to get it back which was $600 more then I owed on the loan. UGH! \nThe only reason I gave them 1 star is because I can't enter the review with no stars!",

Especially when other places such as supermarkets or even the post office charge UNDER A DOLLAR! I had even checked the website before hand just to see how much the charge was for a money order and the site didn't give one. That's probably because they know $5 is too dang high! Unfortunately, I was in a rush so I had to pay the 5 bucks but dang. Lesson learned.  Do you know what I could've done w/ $5? Well let me tell you: Costco's gas is currently $2.50/gallon. I could've gotten TWO MORE GALLONS of gas. A $5 foot long from subway before the tax. An Old Navy t-shirt for the low. A pack of hamburger meat. Underwear, b/c you can't have enough underwear. Basically you can buy a lot of things w/ $5 instead of spending it on a dang money order.  I have a checking AND savings account there but charging that hot mess price smh.

I normally do not give anything one star, but this branch has basically done everything to alienate me. There have been numerous times in which I have tried to deposit my student loan checks and income checks here, only to be treated like I am a scam artist, trying to con them out of money. Once, we went in to change my wife's name, since she had legally changed her last name to match mine, and they treated us like we were total crooks. I've been a customer of Wells Fargo since 2001, and they are pretty consistent across the western states, but this is the only horrible branch I have been to. It makes me want to cancel my account. They need to work on their customer skills and learn how to treat customers with respect and trust. It is understandable that in this day and age, that banks need to protect themselves from hordes of dishonest people, but treating every customer like they are there to cheat the bank and uncomfortably checking all of their information without as much as a smile is disappointing. I would not recommend this branch to anyone. Just use their ATMS. The automated/non-human part is just fine.",

    "text": "State Farm is a great neighbor until you need their help, then you are on your own with half-truths, and misdirection. Will make this short and to the point, as to not drag on about an awful experience. Late 2013 we had a bad storm come through the valley that caused damage to our roof, which then caused damage to the interior drywall. All was well when I called state farm who burst into action and sent over people to begin drying everything out and an adjuster to look over the damage.. Funny enough (Now I know is part of their SOP) State farm found no damage from the storm to the roof (how did water get in) but did say the storm was bad enough to cause rain to blow up underneath the Tiles and cause the leak. Sounds Fishy, but fine, they are the \"experts\". Here is where Cheuvront Construction comes into the action, their \"trusted\" contractor; State farm sends them to do the work, which was fine by me, as I haven't the time to track down contractors, and I felt good knowing they were a \"trusted\" contractor of State Farm. While there they check the roof and say they find one spot that they think may have been a part of the leak, which was weird since state farm said they saw no damage, so we pay OUT OF OUR POCKET to Cheuvront Construction to fix what they see may be a cause of the damage. State farm is made aware of this and we move on.. Come 8-3-14.. Another bad storm and the leak appears again, so I call state farm who says to call Cheuvront Construction and that they'll send out an adjuster.. Adjuster finds no damage this time, and cannot explain the leak (awesome) while Cheuvront Construction now says that we need a new roof (without coming to look at it), so we need a new roof per state farms \"trusted' contractor, but according to state farm there is no damage.. No loss paid out.. This goes on twice more with the same result. State farm won't hold their \"trusted\" contractor responsible, and they claim no damage, which is strange since before that bad storm the roof was fine when it rained. Fast forward to present day, state farm just cancelled our policy, and the only answer I have received is that our insurance isn't good enough anymore, or something to that effect. \nAfter being informed of this I call the office, then attempt to contact them via email through state farms own website, which In the past I used when adding coverage (funny they responded immediately then) All in all this was a horrific experience stemming from Cheuvront Construction, state farms trusted/guaranteed contractor, being involved in our repairs, and claims adjusters who see no storm damage from storms powerful enough to drive rain up a slope and under the tiles... \n\nBravo, guys! You have shown me what horrific customer service truly is. So now I have to get new home owners Insurance, and they won't even help provide the docs I need to get new coverage.. So not only did they \"miss\" the damage that their own contractor fixed, but they also would not hold their contractor or selves accountable to correct the mistake. mind you, this isn't some upset guy on a rampage, I have Life insurance, auto, and personal article policies with state farm to this day, but that will change now that I have been told kick rocks and sorry but we cannot even supply one document necessary for you to get coverage.. A document every other insurer has said they would supply in the same scenario. I even spoke with an underwriter from State Farm who let me know to file a grievance with the executive claims department, but that there was nothing rake she could do. \nThere was a nice young lady at this office by the name of Tiana, who absolutely did try to help in getting me some docs, but State Farm as a whole failed me in the most horrific manner. Although I know it won't make a bit of difference, I've file with the BBB on the agency, the contractor, and State Farm corporate withy hope it's helps even one person avoid this abortion. \n\nIf anyone is looking for insurance, I had a local Allstate & Geico agent bend over backwards to get me insured, even with all this mess going on. I even saved $4 a month on my premium with the company I chose.",

Don't come here! unless you want to be lied to!\n\nI used Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. \n\nIf you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.\nThe situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would \"take care of us\" which is also another broken promise.\n]In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th.

    "text": "I've been using ahg for a couple years on 3 properties that I own. For the first year, I had no issues. I had a couple repair requests, and they were handled with no issues. When it came time to renew one of my policies they called to ask if I wanted to renew. When I said yes, they took it upon themselves to renew me with the 5 star upgrade and renewed the wrong property. When I brought this to their attention, instead of changing the policy address and refunding the 5 star upgrade, they just recharged me for a whole new policy less the 5 star upgrade. So now I've been charged nearly $800 for the one policy I was renewing. When I called about this their response was \"well we didn't refund the policy that we accidentally renewed since its also due to be renewed in a month anyway\". When I told them this was credit card fraud since they never got my permission to do this, they refunded me the initial charge after a 5 day wait. \n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt and kept my policies with them. But the latest issue I've had is with a plumbing service call I just had done. I called it in, paid the $55 service fee and the plumber showed up. They promptly told me that the blockage I called about isn't covered by ahg. Ok, no problem. I proceeded to pay the plumber out of pocket for the repairs. The total came to $229. When\nI asked the plumber if that was less the $55 I already paid, I was told no, that money goes to ahg and they keep it regardless if it's a covered repair or not. When I called ahg, they confirmed this and said that the $55 is their fee to dispatch the call regardless if it's a covered repair or not. They said their contract clearly calls it a fee, not a deductable. So I basically threw that $55 away on the gamble that the repair would be covered. \n\nI give them 2 stars since they started off as a very good company that did promptly cover the repairs in their contract. But they are quickly approaching 1 star level with their approach of ripping their customers off and hiding behind their vague contract language to justify it. \n\nI think when my other policies expire, I will be looking to switch to another warranty company.",

AHG is at the bottom of the pit and if there was a ZERO rating I would use it.  Very poor customer service and although I was told that taking the \"Elite Coverage\" all items would be covered except my pool.  Not true.  I first had an issue with a toilet leak from the Master bath which caused a lot of damage to the downstairs dining room ceiling and wall by the time it was detected.  Since the damage was noticed within 30 days of close of escrow there was no coverage.  My upstairs AC was not cooling and apparently needed Freon.  Again the gas was not covered although my Agent had been told that everything with the AC units was covered.  I have wasted my money on the lousy company and would recommend anyone looking for a home warranty stay far away from this piece of garbage.",

    "text": "Read your contract, and don't believe in a word they tell you otherwise.\nI switched to them from AHS the second year I bought my house - AHS was too expensive. I guess all the warranty companies are pretty much the same, though I had no issues with AHS. \nI researched for about two weeks before deciding on AHG based on their competitive pricing, and what they told me over email, assuring me that even in the case of my 20 year old home's HVAC breaking down, they would pay up to (yeah, watch that \"up to\") $5000 instead of only a fraction of what's required to repair or replace it. They bragged about how \"no one else goes that high.\" So long as I purchase the platinum protection plan.\nWell, unlike what they had told me, when my heat broke down 3 months after contracting with them, they would only pay $900 instead of $2000 because they had decided to cut me a check instead of replacing or repairing it. However, since they decide to cut me a check, they could just give me a depreciated amount. Wow, what a way to weasel out of things.\nI sent a complaint to Better Business Bureau and they ignored me for the whole 30 days of it. I waited for them to reply patiently since BBB allows the 30 days for companies to respond. When I wrote to AHG asking why they had ignored my complaint, they completely denied it and called me a liar, forcing BBB to give up on the case. Lucky for them, this did not put a dent on their rating.\nI ended up filing a small claims court suit, but I couldn't afford a lawyer so I had to fight for myself. Unfortunately, all the email communication with them were not considered legal documents, so despite all their lying and rudeness (the company president, Chad, was quite unprofessional, despite my keeping myself under control, but that's an issue no law suit can fix) I could not make the right happen. On the bright side, even though they tried making me pay or their lawyer, the judge did not think my suit was frivolous, and allowed me to ask for that $900 check to be reissued since it had expired by the time the lawsuit was done (took over a year).\nBottom line, they may be worth it if you don' t expect quality or greatness, but don't expect them to cover your loss if it's something you're not willing to pay yourself.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with the way AHG handled my air conditioning system problem. Sonoran Home Services came out for repair and spent 2.5 hours doing nothing but adding 2 pounds of coolant (cost me $100 for the service fee and coolant). That did nothing to cool down my unit. I had very little confidence in the service man as he did not seem to know what to do and mostly sat for those 2.5 hours. There was no improvement in cooling. Several days later, a different service man (I requested someone else) came out and said I had a bad reversing valve. Not sure why the first guy did not see that. AHG picked up the charge for the valve and labor and I had to pay $370 for another service fee and a complete recharge. Still not cooling any better. I decided to buy a completely new unit as the A/C is 17 years old. I talked with AHG and they put me on hold to talk to the manager about me getting some compensation for a new unit (I knew they would not pay right out for a new unit and did not want to go through Sonoran Home Services for a purchase). The manager was conveniently on another line. I was told there would be a call-back right away after the manager was appraised of the situation. That was 3 days ago. I would never trust this company with an A/C unit again. Their practices are also shady. AHG owns Sonoran Home Services, which to me, is also odd. I am sure it saves them a lot of money to also own the service company (A/C, plumbing, and small appliiance repair) but beware the level of expertise the employees have.",

She did her job and when she was giving me change I asked her if she can give me a bag because it to much for me to carry. She said we don't have bags and I looked at her flabbergasted. A lady name Jessica who I soon found out was the service manager came and I explained to her I needed a bag to carry the change out to my car. She said I can't give you a bag because it has out company logo on it that we ordered from Staples. I was once again was shocked how a simple problem could be resolved. So I asked her can I borrow that box you have on the counter and I will return it back to you after I finish putting everything in my car. Jessica said, \"We can't do that because it has the company's logo on it.\" Then I asked her, I can't carry all of these out how do you suggest me to bring it to my car and Jessica said rudely, \"if you know your were going to get change you should have bought your own bag.\" At the point, I was shocked and upset how I was treated because I never gotten this treatment before from any other bank locations. So Jessica walked away, I asked the Liat to direct me so that I can speak to a manager and Liat told me she was the service manager.  I look at the wall and there was a quote that mention courtesy and I wonder how she can be a service manager when she couldn't provided me the standard/basic service of customer service. Jessica came back and I asked her what this location's branch number is she gave me an answer and walked away. After I asked Liat, who is the general manager of this location and she told me that Daniel E. was the branch manager. During that time, some other teller found an empty $300 quarter box and gave it to me to use. Meanwhile, I asked to speak with him and she told me that he was in a meeting. I told that is ok. I will give him a call later. Liat then told me that he just got out and directed me towards him. I inform him about Jessica's rudeness and service. All in all, I would not go back. I would rather go somewhere else where I was treated better. I would honestly give them a zero star but since the branch manager attempted to talk to me I gave them a 1 star.",

He didn't go back and forth like other lenders asking for a page a day. Very organized manner of running business which made the whole process run very smoothly. We've been through 3 purchases now, and about 4 refis and none ever ran this smoothly. Will definitely come back to Rusty if I purchase or refi again.",

Just recently moved to Vegas and plan to purchase a place that I can call HOME.  Since as an self-employed performer that mostly goes by contracts to contracts even I had huge down-payment and great numbers of  tax return from the last three years. I called so many different Banks and Mortgage broker for loan. On the phone they actually simply said that to me over the phone \"don't waste both our time\". I almost give up keep finding for loan until I found Rusty on Yelp. I thought just give another shot to hear the same answer over again......! And I called and told Rusty my situation and he got me the answer is YES. I can do it for you! Then went to meet him at his office and showed everything he need simply he got me pre-approval letter right away....! Until then I still not 100% sure that he can really got it done for me until I owned a house one week ago. He helped me closed a house with in just TWO WEEKS from I placed an offer. Even my realtor she couldn't believed it went so fast and smooth. She said she never closed a house that quick since she is been working in the real estate for 10 YEARS. Not even cash offer could closed that fast.....! What can I say about that. I am so happy and LUCKY that I found him that he helped got my first home with this situation! I WOULD STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend Rusty to all my performer friends or whoever have hard time to get home loan before giving up just give he a call and he might have solution for you......! Thank you so much Rusty!",

This left me in a tough spot as I got back in town and only learned about the insurance lapsing from a snail mail letter, and it was a weekend so Ryan's office was closed.

From our initial conversation, he explained the home buying process to me and what necessary documents I would need to start.

Once I found a home and my offer was accepted, Rusty went right to work. I was able to go in his office to sign my loan application within a week of my offer being accepted, he had my appraisal scheduled right away and because we did most of my underwriting during the pre-approval process I was ready to close 2 and half weeks after my offer was accepted, I ended up only closing a day early because the seller wasn't ready to move so fast. \n\nBefore buying my home, I did a lot of research on what to expect and I was planning on running into some issues but with Rusty he made it as easy and stress free as possible.

My parents have been searching for a company to do their living trust for quite some time now, but with some difficult circumstances going on with our family through the past couple years it was rough finding it in the budget. One thing that caught my parents eye was the free consultation. Sean was the rep who met with them, and helped explain the whole probate process how they could assist with my parents wants and needs. He was also very helpful by offering a payment plan for them since they're on a fixed income at the moment. My mom had no problems rescheduling the delivery because they wanted me to sit in on the delivery of the trust. I was impressed on how professional Sean was and just how much he cared about my parents being happy with outcome of their trust. 10/10 would recommend this company!",

At the time the checking accounts gave 5.25% APY on your checking account balance, far better than any savings account.  Over the past two years that rate has dropped to 2.25%, which is still higher than most every savings account.\n\nNot only do you get an APY, but recently they changed their overdraft fees.

They have a 24 hour calling center located in Raleigh NC and anytime I've had a problem they've fixed it immediately.  \n\nAgain locations is the problem, there are NO Coastal Federal CU's in Charlotte or anywhere near.

Due to the complexity of our tax situation, we value face to face meetings with our CPA.   \n\nIt was tough leaving our 10+ year relationship with our former CPA who did an outstanding job, but meeting personally with him would've been difficult and inconvenient (not wanting video conferencing, etc.) because of our relocation to Arizona.\n\nMy wife and I carried out some research and found outstanding customer reviews of Steven Vogt, CPA which led us to become first time clients.  In the end, we were pleasantly surprised and relieved that we owed far less than we had anticipated.   \n\nHaving met both the co-owners Steve and Leslie (not to mention some of their senior staff and tax preparers),  I can tell you first hand that they do their absolute best (and did) to have us pay the least amount of taxes possible. We also found the cost of having them prepare our taxes to be competitive and in line with what we paid with our previous CPA.  \n\nOne last thing I would like to mention is that even though they were very busy (a steady stream of fellow clients coming in to start the tax process or picking up their completed taxes) during our two meetings with them, we never felt rushed and their staff was very friendly as well which is important to us.\n\nWe're looking forward to our continued relationship with Steve and Leslie's CPA firm as they've earned our trust.",

I asked when I would have a full appointment when I checked out (pretty ticked off).  I was told that was my appointment.  Of course I received my tax documents with a whole lot of problems.  Which I was charged way more than anyone else I have worked with because they had to go back and redo so much. I never received one phone call asking for clarifying information.  They just filled it out at the quoted price with a five minute meeting and then charged a whole lot more to redo.   There is no way I could recommend this tax preparer to anyone.",

The Tax Preparer sat with me for 5 MINUTES! He asked 1 question and I explicitly told him about a big change with my business.  5 minutes after my appointment, I got a survey request, where I expressed my concerns, but did not hear from anyone.  1 week later I go to get my taxes, and sure enough, there were mistakes (A tax preparer who used ASSUMPTIONS!). They were good, but have grown and they lost the personal touch.  I fail to see how they are any different than Turbo Tax (other than price).  I fill out my organizer, they fill out some paperwork and electronically file it.  Last year using them.",

When it first opened a few years ago this was a very nice branch, with nice and helpful people.  \n\nNow they have had 2 managers in a row, with the current one, Orlando Gutierrez being particularly horrible.  He is rude, egotistic and like to break the rules of his own company.  He, and his people have been reported to mess with peoples accounts without permission, open accounts to meet quotas without permission and closing his branch early on many occasions.  \n\nTop this off him and the personal bankers at this branch are rude, and unhelpful.  The last two times I went there customers were yelling in the branch because they are so upset at these people.  \n\nI went to another branch today to do my business, I told them that I had a bad experience at Wells Fargo and they guessed it was this branch and Orlando that were so bad.  The worker at the other branch said that most people who work there either quit or leave, and that he personally processed 14 complaints about that branch in the last month.  \n\nWhatever you do, help yourself out and don't visit this branch, there are too many nice people at other branches in the area to make yourself deal with this.",

Cool that's fine save me money right? Well the guy started setting up my information. Not only did we not do this at a desk we stood at the teller booth and he wanted me to say my ssn out loud with other people around and my current bank account # and address/full name. In this day and age. No thanks. He than had to come out and go to one of their Web Access computers in the lobby and get me to log in, than run back to the teller booth. Now I'm still dealing with the mess this man made of my account!  He set me up with an instant card. Doesn't work but get this the old card from my old account does...wth? Did my money get transfered out of my old account to the new one? NOPE. I had to call wells Fargo and they said the money was \"locked in\" and the account isn't fully closed it could take up to 3 weeks...uhh No way! So I had to call the branch and they figured it out but seriously it was SUCH a huge hassle. And not to mention the company I'm with now banks with Wells Fargo, this branch is convenient and close. Needless to say we drive to the arrowhead branch on 75th and bell SO worth it!!!\nI've given this branch a couple tries and now I'm running for arrowhead everytime.",

A place where they've figured out a way to actually live their \"banking can be this comfortable\" slogan.\n\nInnovation abound, buckle up because this is not your grandfathers, fathers... heck it's not even your older brothers bank, so you might be surprised at how they're upping their game to service a new younger generation of clientele.\n\nThe biggest difference you might notice, there are ZERO tellers. That's right, no lining up to deposit your cheques, take out small bills, international currency exchange. But not to worry, where there once was a teller, there is a new innovative ATM that allows you to do many of these transactions, including taking out small bills from your account. Want $20 in $5 bill increments? You can here!\n\nHow about when you use the regular ATM? Well that is a standard experience, except when the front desk welcome staff walks over and offers you a coffee, tea or glass of water while you're taking your money out!\n\nThey are also home to one of the only vaults with absolutely no cash money in. So why have it? So you can rent a safety deposit box, the whole thing is filled with them. The brand manager (Andrew) explained that SDB's are hard to come by and these boxes are selling like hot cakes - so if you're looking for one act fast.\n\nNow for the most impressive feature in my opinion, their layout. Couches and lounge chairs everywhere, free wifi and mobile phone charging stations. The reason for this? While they currently have 3 offices for your more intimate and lengthy transactions (loans, mortgages, bank account set up, etc), before long you'll have the option of taking these meetings on a couch with an adviser and the only piece of technology between the two of you will be an ipad. So you can choose to have your meeting on a couch in their lounge, on bar stools side by side on a counter, OR even in their heavily beaded curtain enclosed area known as 'the cloud'. If you still like privacy for your big money talk, not to worry, the offices are still there to meet in!\n\nOverall a very comfortable and innovative banking experience and Mississauga is very lucky to have the first of its kind. Don't be too jealous if you live in Toronto, TD looks to open the second branch of this kind shortly right near Liberty Village!\n\nBanking is now more comfortable than ever!",

    "text": "I moved to the area over the summer and came to K&M on a recommendation....big mistake.  I figured how bad could they be?  Their servicing was horrible and they lied about their billing and for as simple as tax services should be, they failed to deliver as I would have expected.\n\nBefore moving forward I explained my situation and how I intended to file and asked for a quote.  They told me $320, which was on par with what I had paid in the past.  I sent them my tax information two weeks before the filing deadline and figured all was well.  After not hearing anything for about 10 days, I called to see where everything stood.  I had not included one of my state W-2 and they could not finish my taxes.  They failed to reach out to me to ask for this additional information which I found surprising.  When were they going to find me...April 16.  I asked them to assess my filing method (Married join or married single) to figure out which would be more beneficial and they never addressed that question.  Let's move on.\n\nThey are not very accessible which odd during tax season.  Their office hours are from 9PM - 4PM.  If you need to speak to them outside those times, better use email or leave a message and wait them to get back to you.  Once they finally completed my returns, they e-filed them but never bothered to ask how I wanted to get my refunds?  They filed and I received my refunds via check but did not ask if I wanted electronic payment.  A very surprising practice since electronic payments are quicker and more secure than checks.  Clearly they did not have their customer's best interest in mind. \n\nLastly, the bill.  After they completed their service and explained the status of my returns, I informed them of the $50 off online coupon I would be using.  When their invoice came, I was expecting to see their original quote of $320.00 less the $50.00 discount.  Instead, the adjusted the base fee up to $370.00 and then took off $50.00.  I was stunned to see such deceitful behavior.  If they were willing to lie about their billing, I am now wondering if they even did my taxes correctly.  I am considering trying to find a new tax services firm to have them review their work.\n\nSo...if you want limited access to your tax preparer, want to get your refund the slowest means possible and want to be incorrectly billed, use K&M Accounting and Tax Services.",

After paying off my pawn tickets $425.00 after they had been renewed several times over the past year I inquired about my layaway that I did back in November of 2013. \n\nThe assistant manager Art told me that the lawaway was cancelled back in January. I advised Art that I was given no time limit in which to pay the layaway and get this he said he knows and that's why they had to write staff up because they were telling customers there was no time limit.\n\nI then said well can I at least use the money I already paid ($45.00) and use that towards the lawaway and just pay it off today?\n\nHe said NO because there is a 90 day layaway time limit. I advised him there was no time limit given to me. He said he couldn't prove that. I said you just mentioned that you had to write staff up because of them telling customers there was no time limit.\n\nHe then starting talking about policy this and that.\n\nKeep in mind, they cancelled my layaway in January of this year and put the two items back on the floor. \n\nWe are now in May (5 Months Later) and the two items are now on the floor for sale. \n\nStill!!!!\n\nSo instead of making the sale, clearing inventory and keeping a 3 year customer happy and coming back Art wants to hide behind \"policy\", keep my $45 and lose a customer.\n\nWho promoted Art?

And from what I can tell, they have all of their teeth.  No really, they are all really nice guys! \n\nEvery time I visit Pawn 1st they are somewhat busy.

He comes out to tell me friend that shes been approved etc, all while not making eye contact at all, just staring at the ground.

They promptly responded to my email and within 1 day the Area, District or office Manager \"Bruce\" called my son. Bruce immediately resolved the issue and refunded my son what he felt he was over charged. I was very impressed with the follow up to my complaint and how quickly and well handled it was. Thanks to Bruce!\n\n\nThis is the worst service and rip off company I have ever experienced! My son went to file his taxes. last year he used Liberty and they charged $126 and he filed his taxes for both AZ and Calif.. This year he only filed for Az and they said $226? He complained so the girl went to the manager Anthony Ferroni. He said I will give you a $80 discount, By the time my son signed the paper work and left he received an email that had fees of $126, + $40 handling fee, plus a $20 misc fee and another $9 fee ++++++. Bottom line his $600 refund turned into a $380 refund as Liberty tacked on all these fees.\nSo as the father I called Liberty and spoke to Anthony the manager. He basically said \"sorry we already filed his taxes\" (this was 1 hour after my son left). He then said Mr Kelly do you know what the Arizona fees are?? I responded- What does that have do do with you over charging my son? He then responds \"we do not want your sons business,  Please go somewhere else next year\". Wow what a bad experience. Anthony is a jerk and should not be representing a company like Liberty Tax.  Bottom line, Anthony is an idiot and a jerk. No help, no sympathy, just there to RIP OFF young and unsuspecting people.",

    "text": "Finally I understand why the rating of this bank is so low. I have been the customer of boa for 4 years since I have been the US in 2013. This branch is alway with the lowest working efficiency. They alway let customers wait at least 15mins to see the bankers even if I have an appointment in advance. I came to this location on Monday 3pm to make wire transfer(they close at 5pm). Only one banker was on duty that day, and the manager told me all the appointments were scheduled on that day so I have to come back tomorrow to see a banker. So I made an appointment for Tuesday 11am. On Tuesday when I arrived the branch at 11:05am (cause I spent 7mins to find a parking space on mill avenue), no banker nor manager was in the lobby except one cashies who was taking care of one customer. I waited until 11:12 the manager came out to told me since I was late they let another walkin customer to go to see the banker first cause she arrived early. I was really confused with the stupid policy. If they can do walk in prior to appointment, why they refused to service me on Monday? Now I really want to cancel my account and move to any other bank on mill avenue like Chase or Wells Fargo.",

This branch is severely understaffed. The wait just to see a teller is always a minimum of 30 minutes. If you want to see an actual banker you are looking at around an hour wait usually. Like I said, the staff is always super helpful and friendly but the wait times are unacceptable and something that needs to be addressed.",

    "text": "I am right on board with Wenchi on this one. Although this is the first time I have purchased, I could not see the process going any worse for us. I have a long list of emails from both our agent and myself that weren't answered in anything near a timely manner. \n\nIf you call the mortgage center line, it goes straight to voicemail. If you call Roger's number, same thing. Elizabeth never provided us her number, instead saying everything would be handled via email. Again, slow to respond to those emails would be an understatement. I did call the branch, asking them to transfer me to Roger's extension. That was the only way I could get him to answer. I assume his caller ID was showing a One Nevada Credit Union number calling, and he thought it might be \"someone important\". Nope, just me. \n\nWe were told that final underwriting has a 24 hour turn around. We had our requirements filed on a Thursday, and didn't hear back from Roger until Monday, after business hours, that it was kicked back as incomplete. That's 3 business days later, plus two weekend days. The only part incomplete was that they had taken so long from the initial documentation, that my pay stubs were now too old. And because of the program we used, we needed another year's tax return. Shouldn't the loan officer know that would be needed?!? According to Roger when he did finally get back to me, he had known about it, and Elizabeth had been bugging him to call us. So why didn't he? We sent everything in that Tuesday, since he had called after business hours Monday, and it wasn't until Friday when I sent my \"threatening to go elsewhere\" email (see next paragraph) that we heard anything back. That's 8 days after we initially sent the documentation. \n\nJust like Wenchi said, we got the excuse that it was because they had so many loans to deal with. I can understand that. So I sent an email to Roger wondering what was going on, and asking if I should look for a different lender. I asked for him to please let me know if One Nevada was too busy to service my loan. Lo and behold, 9 minutes later, he had read, typed and sent an email back to me. This was record breaking speed for them. Funny how that is when you're threatened with losing your commission. Unfortunately, Roger started said email with \"Matt, calm down\". WOW!! Not how I like to do business. \n\nLike I said, that was on a Friday. Another weekend passed, many more emails from my agent asking when to extend escrow until, both to Roger and Elizabeth, again without answer. Roger then called saying we needed to show more money for our 20% down payment. We had made cash deposits that aren't able to be tracked. Understandable. However, when I went over the numbers with him, and cross-referenced with the title company, it wasn't adding up. That caused another week to pass. Yesterday, Tuesday, the 11th of October, we finally got the closing disclosures. Sure enough, my numbers were right, and the extra $2000 gift we had to solicit wasn't even needed, we had enough traceable funds all along. September 29th we could have been at closing documents, but no. \n\nAgain, I emailed Roger. This time, \"I know that you might not understand what the complete process entails for a home loan\" is the way he starts things. It was simple math. I get that numbers can change, but you're the ones that give us the numbers. Don't give me an estimate that is $6,000 off, take the time to get the number right. \n\nWe have now had to file an addendum twice to extend escrow due to lack of communication from One Nevada. Initially, any refinance was going to be through them, but now, not only will that not be happening, but my checking and savings, as well as my son's account that I just opened for his first birthday, will be going elsewhere. \n\nPlease don't take this review to show any negativity towards the branches. They were amazing to work with. Very helpful and polite. Each time I walked in, they made sure to greet me, and apologize if there was ever a wait, which there rarely was.\n\nSince I have posted, another review (2 stars) was removed. That is the person \"Wenchi\" that I refer to.",

I called to ask for their Saturday hours, right at 2:00, but it turned out that was when they closed.  But Chase Bank's Adam offered to stay and wait for me to get there so i could retrieve my document!  On his Saturday!  I was blown away.  They are always friendly at the two Madison Chase locations i frequent, this    experience took place at the one downtown across from the capial, but they are also always extremely kind and helpful at the branch on the westside off of High Point Rd as well.

    "text": "This company is as useless as it gets and my intent is to build a website to start garnishing documentation to file a class action lawsuit against them for illegal banking practices. \n\nI purchased the domain this morning (05.13.2016) - http://disputecreditonebank.com. Please allow me until end of day on 05.15.2016 to finish the site. I am inviting you to post your complaints about unfair dealing practices if you are impacted. If you are a lawyer and wish to pick this class action suit, please visit the page and leave us your details. I appreciate the help.\n\nI had an offer in the mail to use their product and decided to make use of their services as I was building my credit. I used them for the past 6 months, paying my bills on time and not focusing on the transactions on my account, assuming all transactions to be correct. I had an illegal charge go through my card on 5.13.2016 and called them to dispute the issue. I was told that they could not do anything to help and I wondered what kind of protection is offered to the consumers. I talked with an account supervisor (Jenny / id 0313024888) and an account manager (Desiree / id 0313065028). I regularly bank with Chase and Capital One and had never heard of anything so ludicrous. They could not help but asked me to send a letter to their Las Vegas office to start the proceedings.\n\nBefore putting my thoughts on paper, I spent time reviewing my statement for any discrepancies and this morning noted that I have been charged $4.22 monthly for credit protection which I did not authorize. I called Capital One again and was told that the charge had been levied by a sister company and they could not cancel it. My acceptance of the credit card came with a rider, the additional charge of credit protection which I did not authorize. I was transferred to another number but could not get a human to initiate the cancellation. How is it that the company that swore to protect me and help me build my credit is imposing unauthorized charges?\n\nI asked them the reps at Credit One who regulated their bank and to whom could I escalate my issue. Anticipating that I would be told FDIC, I was referred to the BBB. When does BBB regulate banks? They are completely clueless, unethical and corrupt. This has to change. The journey starts with you, please do not suffer in silence. Leave me your story and let others learn from you.\n\nThe consumer affairs website gave them a 1 star rating with 908 complaints - https://www.consumeraffairs.com/credit_cards/credit_one.html\n\nDo not use them if you have a choice. My balance is small; I will pay it down and close the account after I have brought light to their unethical behavior.\n\nI am also posting the names of the sister banks here, beware!!\n* Bank One Credit Helper\n* Capital One Financial Corporation\n* Comenity Bank\n* HSBC Mortgage Corp USA\n* HSBC Finance Corp.\n* Affinion Group, Inc.",

Anyway, I found hundreds of dollars had been charged to a credit card that I had not used since 2015. I called the company and they did an investigation and found I had fraudulent charges on my card. I had been told not to do anything until investigation was over, so, I hadn't. They cancelled that card and sent me a new one. When I got my new card, the balance had been transferred and $50 had been credited back to my account. Keep in mind, I had accumulated $300+ in fraudulent charges. I called them and asked \"WTF??\" in so many words.  They said it's still under investigation.  Then, I started receiving calls telling me to pay my balance. Every time I explain that this isn't my balance and every time there are issues. They've put me on hold for hours, hung up on me, called 5 times in a row, whatever. It's getting ridiculous. They called again today and when I asked why my balance was still so high, they told me they can't see my balance on my previous card which is where the issue started. I asked to speak with someone who can see the balance, i.e. a supervisor, and was then transferred to customer service. She told me it was STILL under investigation and to bear with them. Also, in the same breath, asked for a payment....AHHHHH!! I asked if this payment they would be receiving from me would be credited back to me once the investigation was over. She said she can guarantee it but when I asked for an email or letter stating that guarantee, she could not comply.  Also, I have already received a letter from the company stating the charges were fraudulent and that the charges were credited to my account. Which is false since only one charge was credited at that time.",

I had their credit card back in 2001 when they were still FNBM (First National Bank of Marin). I used the card for many years, it was expensive but I had no complaints until I missed a payment one month. I figured I would just double up the next month being young and not grasping the importance of credit. Well, Day 45 the card charged off! That was pretty harsh. I would not do business with them. I was recently offered their card again and was like really?! My credit is way out of their league now.",

I've had my card for nearly two years, have never missed a payment or been late. Not once, not ever. Despite my credit score of 722, I still am charged an annual fee, have a high interest rate (24%), and a very low credit limit ($950). I've been a loyal customer and have other cards with much lower rates, no annual fee and high credit limits. This card offers no perks / rewards to boot. The customer service rep I spoke to today informed me that their bank refuses to remove my annual fee or lower my credit score. I wouldn't recommend this card to anyone. Ever.\n\nIn short...\nActivation Fee: $75\nAnnual Fee: $6.24/mo\nIntroductory Credit Limit: $500\nCredit Increases: Infrequent and minimal",

Well back in Aug 2014 I accidently made two payments to my Capital one credit card thinking I had made one of those payments to creditone. The mistake was easy to make their symbols are nearing copywrite infringement. Well when my account with them became past due 35 days I received a call from the folks in the Phillipines informing me I was late. I gave them a o hell no! Well checking my records the gentleman on three phone was right. Well I then asked him as I was concerned they would report me as 30 days late on my credit report I asked him if I were to clear this up now would it not hit my credit report negatively. He told me if he cleared it up on the phone now the payment would go thru before it was reported as late to the credit card companies. This was the one and only time I was late and it was an honest mistake. Well a month later i reviewed my credit report and sure enough they reported me as late it dropped my credit score 65 points! I have spoken to their customer service, supervisors. All of which is a terrible experience. They lie to you, and are very scripted. They constantly hang up the phone on you and when u ask to speak to someone in America they flat out tell you no. I have sent three dispute letters to them with a copy of my report and the dispute in question. I have disputed this with all three credit  bureaus with no success on getting this removed. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS RUN AROUND BS WITH THIS COMPANY. It is hands now the worst experience I have had with any company. I don't have any intentions on stopping my pursuit to clear this up.",

    "text": "CreditOne was one of the first companies to give me a card after I lost my job and my credit was ruined, but considering I was the kind of person this company PREYS on, I do not extend them accolades for this. I had their card for over three years and every interaction I had with them was painful. Their customer service people are extremely rude and have accents so thick you can't hardly understand them, then they get pissy when you have to continuously ask them to repeat themselves. And get this: the reason I no longer have an account with them is because they closed it out from under me BECAUSE I TRIED TO MAKE A PAYMENT. Yes, that's right. I had two accounts listed on my online account to make payments from; one I rarely used. Well, one day I had to use it. Huh, strange, it's been a week and that money hasn't been taken from my account yet, so I try again. THEN I get a LETTER in the mail (instead of emailing me like they did for other things) telling me that the account I tried to use to make a payment was invalid (what?!) and if I tried to use it again they'd suspend my account. So I call, and they want me to get some kind of form filled out from a brick and mortar location proving they exist (again, WHAT?!) BUT, it's an online bank, so they don't have a branch I can visit! I went round and round because apparently, if their screen doesn't tell them what to say off a script, they can't speak or think for themselves. I tell him forget it, just remove that bank from my payment list and I'll add another, and he says he'll unsuspend my account. Two weeks later, my account is still showing suspended so I call again. This time the lady tells me that my account was closed and nope, sorry, can't do anything about it. I was livid, and decided that the best and only way I can get back at them is to pay my account in full so they can't get anymore interest payments out of me. If they're going to treat me like garbage, they're not getting another dime out of me. \n\nDO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT FROM THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU'RE READY TO BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE AND ARE ABSOLUTELY, 100% DESPERATE FOR CREDIT FROM ANYONE, ANYWHERE.

    "text": "Don't open an account with this company. You will regret it I promise. I spent many calls and wrote letters to customer service and to two execs with the company and received no responses. Their Facebook page won't allow any posts which I am sure is to prevent customers from commenting on the extremely poor service. I made multiple calls over the last two months and continue to get transferred from caller to caller including those that speak very little English. On the last call, they disconnected my call after being on about 40 minutes with various customer service representatives. \n\nThe problem resulted from Credit One processing a payment much later than it should have been processed resulting in a late fee rolling into my March statement. I made a payment over the phone in February with one of their representatives that should have brought my account to a -0- balance. My bank, CapitalOne, also verified that this was an electronic payment and not a check mailed. However, for some reason, Credit One did not process this payment until March 6th, almost two weeks after I made the payment over the phone. This resulted in a late payment of 29.07 being assessed on my account in my March statement on 3/5. I made calls in March and in April trying to get this resolved, but experienced horrendous customer service. As a result of their representatives not being able to resolve this, I had another late payment of 33.41 assessed on 4/5. \n\nYou can't reach anyone at their corporate offices as well and NO REPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am moving forward with a complaint with the BBB.",

I had their credit card back in 200.. something I used the card for many years, it was expensive but I had no complaints until I missed a payment one month.I paid the card off in full and then I went traveling abroad. I forgot that they were charging me month to month yearly. Well, I didn't pay the 1st month and I didn't realize it until I looked at my credit report.... I check it nearly daily and it was 32 days late from the only charge was the monthly balance I called them up immediately and rectified my oversight. So now on the 45th day they refuse to remove the late charge from my credit reports,\n\nPathetic business practices.",

    "text": "I am on hold with customer service again and this is my first payment. I only got this card for my sons use. I simply opened a letter with a Credit Card offer and logged in and the card was sent. I am not complaining about the fee because that was my mistake but after the first month of usage I started receiving phone calls from East Indians who you can hardly understand asking me for payments over the phone which I NEVER do. So I came home attempted to log into my account but couldn't so I called on a Saturday \"closed\". Called Monday and asked about my problems with logging on and was told that my account was locked because my account was temporarily closed because I didn't make my payment.\n\nOk, first I was never sent a statement. I was not at 30 days since first use of card. I couldn't access to make a payment. I couldn't reach anyone on a weekend to discuss payment options.\n\nNow this brings me to this current time as I am typing this... I am still on hold after making a payment over the phone and being transferred to the (couldn't understand what they said department) but I was hoping to speak to someone that could help with login issues. Anyways another East Indian tells me that I can't access my account until I provide verification from my bank? I asked for what and he replied to open my account again. I said I don't understand I need to access my account to make payments, watch activity, etc. Again, you need to send verification from your bank that you made a payment. Again, I said \"huh\", I just made an over the phone payment when that payment clears will my account unlock so I can access my account online? He said not until you mail in your verification from the bank. \n\nSo here is the good part, OK I want to close my account! He says it's already closed! I asked so do you mean to tell me I have no further action to close my account permanently? No, it's closed. I am waiting to speak to a supervisor 33 mins and still holding.  All in all this is one of those cards that will fee you to death and at any point that you use it they will not send statements, lock you out of your account and charge you a $9.95 fee for overt the phone payment. RUN, RUN, RUN as people say.\n\n Close your account and stop the bleeding. Ok, 36 mins in and the call was disconnected. \n\nI am going to talk to a supervisor and ensure the account is closed at my request and follow through in a couple of weeks. The rough part is I can't go online to ensure the account was closed, you can't trust the people you talk with...... I guess I will have to purchase some type of credit monitoring to ensure they didn't add some type of fee to close my account for which they will send you no statement, no email for this fee that could potentially damage your credit for nonpayment of something you knew nothing about..",

I filled out the online form and received an\ninstant decision of a limit of 400 dollars as well as 19.99% apr and 45.00 application fee. Upon receiving the card, the offer had changed to a higher APR and a 75.00 fee as well as a monthly membership fee going forward the second year. This is not what i agreed to and refused to activate card. I called the outsourced customer service and spoke at first to a rep. unfortunately i did not write his name or rep number down. He told me it was my fault and i accepted the wrong offer. i immediately requested the card not be activated unless agreed terms were met. He then transferred me to supervisor Eddie rep # 76958 who proceeded to read a script and apologize again and again. When he could not resolve my simple request based on an offer the bank extended me and baited and switched to a newer less desirable offer. I was then transferred to steve 51243 whom all he did was apologize and say he can transfer me to corporate in the usa. I was transferred to Rep Wendy 2567 who explained again that it was my fault and i should have been more careful. Wendy said she could give me the agreed upon fee but it would be difficult to adjust the APR.I informed Wendy of my agreement of the terms with the proviso of no 99.00 membership fee she was unable to do so Whilst she was pleasant she was not very helpful. In closing i would like the offer originally extended to me, if not i demand confirmation of closed account wit no charges and a removal of hard credit inquiry from my Credit report. I think this was a bait and switch and i will continue availing myself of all consumer remedies available to me.",

Also, if this is the only card you are qualifying for, you have gone wayward in the past with your credit. It's not surprising (and mostly likely not the banks fault) you're having trouble with this card too. I've had this card for 7 years and no troubles. Started with a $500 limit, crappy credit and now I'm at $2k and several other regular bank cards. I only keep it open because it would severely drop the age of my accounts if I closed it. Yes, the fees are crazy and the apr is high but look in the mirror people, YOU ARE A HIGH RISK for credit. I'm sure half their accounts are in some collection status. If you're really paying with a debit card, just use your bank info and enroll in online payments (free). It takes like 3-4 days to post. You shouldn't be in that much of a hurry to burn up that credit again and if you are, you need to learn how to manage your finances. I'm great full for credit one.

Took a while but finally got the fees reversed but had to switch from one type of account to some other so it would not happen again......or so I was told. \n\nI was not pleased with the service on the phone so decided to walk into the branch on N. Durango.  After a very short wait my husband and I were introduced to Jessica G., the Customer Service Sales Rep.  We sat at her desk and within the first 5 minutes had everything taken care of.  Turns out the account the person on the phone gave us had \"strings\" attached to keep it free from any service fees.....she NEVER said anything about those.  JESSICA went over each type of account, asked what services we really needed and got everything straightened out to our satisfaction.  Maybe the \"help\" at the 800# should get lessons from Jessica.....she knew her job and did it extremely efficiently and friendly.  It was a pleasure doing business with Jessica!!!!!",

    "text": "This bank is located on Decatur between Lake Mead & Vegas Dr. \nWent on Wednesday 12-16-15 at 12:05 PM to get a money order. \nOut of the 8 windows, only three were open.  The line was about 20 deep and a bank employee was walking around the line with an iPad asking each person what they were there for and taking their debit card info.  People who had issues that can be taken care of by a banker (new accounts, questions, etc) were pulled out of the line and taken to the other side to see a banker.  When I finally got the window 23 minutes later I was asked again for my debit card info and what I am there to do.  \nI tell the teller I need a money order and she has me write the amount and who it should be made out to on a post-it and she dissapears for 6 minutes.  I can see her on the phone flipping through a large binder with papers in it.  Is she getting instructions on how to create a money order?  Are they having technical difficulties?  Guess I'll never know.  \nWhen she came back I was hounded by the usual questions: \nLady: Did you know you are pre-qualified for an exciting credit card offer? \nMe:  No thank you. Don't believe in them. \nLady: But it only has x amount of interest! \nMe: No thanks, lady...they're against my religion.  \nLady: Okay but if you change your mind you can bla bla bla (I stopped listening). \nMe: Ok gotcha.  Cool beans.   \nAnd it's like that every single time I go to the bank.  If it's not the credit card thing, it's them hitting me up for renter's insurance.  The time before this they tried to convince me that if I get their credit card and anything happens to my cell phone they will pay to replace it. I feel sorry for the poor employees who have to harass these poor people who have waited in line so long they are already irritated.  I'm glad I don't work there.\nAdditionally they call me about once a week to ask if I want financial planning. I'm getting pretty tired of this bank.",

They explain  the insurance concept and show you information about how each product can solve the problem when filing a claim,\nBut agents dont have on their welcome to our insurance  brocher or they themselves wont tell you is  their are actual customer complaint graphs  , websites and blogs (that you need to read  ) trying to spread the information  to people having to buy (forced by our goverment /states ,dmv)auto insurance  complaints . Complaints after complaints  making sure that you understand that you can lose out you hard earned income money and all the interest you pay the bank when buy a car.\n when you have an accident. The problems that arise are .\n\ninsurance controling every $ they spend fixing the problem/repair and dening some of the repair .\n\nControling how long you can have your rental and dening you the  full car rental coverage\n\nTotaling your car.\n\nDening you , cause you dont have proper coverage.\n\nDening you cause your damage was not related to your accident.\n\n\nDening you cause the problem already existed before the accident.\n\nDening you cause the accident was your fault.\n\nAnd raising your payments when you were at fault even if you couldnt prevent it.\n\n Even a policeman can write up a wrong report cause of bad information and blame you for the accident and make your insurance payments go up.\n\nAnd still many more .\n\nAuto insurance companies control how much they will pay the repair shop by giving them insurance job's\n .\nThese shops that except these jobs are getting paid  little to nothing for their work but take the jobs to supplement their income . Insurances adjusters sent from your insurance claim have take look at the damage and give the estimate to the  shop .at the point of meeting  the owner of the shop and the adjuster becomes friends with the owner of the shop .\nThey take care of business but also laugh it up  and can become real good friends.\nSo if I have an accident and the insurance company Tells me to take my car to the an auto shop I preferr or take the car to one of their guaranteed shops. BE CAREFULL\nThis means the auto insurance company  is making you do the work and YOUR deciding what to do .\nINSTEAD OF THEM. Thats a trick\nThey should take your car and have it fixed and deliver it to you ready and done .\n\nInstead what happens is nobody ever drives you car to evaluate the condition of damage .\nYour the only one knows that damage condition\nnow your stuck with dealing with the body shop employees and explaining to them whats wrong with you car\nBut in the back of their mind the body shop estimator already knows what is going to be excecpted by your insurance adjuster .\nSo the body shop estimator wont write down all that you see wrong with your car after being  in an accident. He will say .I will look at it .\nSo not everything will get repaired all the time when its time to pick your car up.\nSo lets pretend your picking up your car at the body shop and you notice something isnt right you complain and the body shops employee or oener that you hire says to you not all repairs were accepted  by your auto insurance\nCall them and complain to them .\nThen the insurance adjuster say its been denied we can only fix some of it. We will send you a letter explaining\nSo now your complaint to the body shop who fixed your  your broken damaged car is not responsible for making your car run like it used to run before the accident .so the complaint has be with your auto insurance that will not spend anymore than thats on their budget to fix and repair your particular car.\nSo you lose out. The body shop and the auto insurance adjuster teamed up against you without you knowing . (Cause now their friends)You have no control of the process.\n Only a black hat team thats works out of an office controlling the system against you.what the agent selling you auto insurance didnt tell you  that there are all kinds of ways to lose out \nIf you try to fight your own Insurance company  forget it .they will fight you tooth and nail and the web reports say that insurance companies always win against their customers\nThey hire high $ attorney's  that  make our regular attorney's performance sick.\nI your fighting and complaining against your Auto Insurance companies they prefer you to sue them in court cause they know they will win.  Thats how they are geared.\n\nYou dont see that on the brochure  because if you did see that you wouldnt buy it . What does the word INSURANCE mean?",

She was amazing! Her extensive knowledge and expertise was consistently displayed as she worked with us to determine the best coverage to meet our needs. As  critical as that was, her positive and engaging personality throughout the process was important to us as well, in addition to the helpful information she shared about relocating to the area. We look forward to continuing to work with Pauline as we transition to Summerlin and know we can count on her for her continued support and knowledge.

I had checked their insurances rates before but they never compared to my current policy until recently when State Farm's rates increased so I went to the office and signed up.  I was told by the agent that she would fax my cancellation letter to State Farm.  I called my State Farm agent the following day and he had not received the fax.  I then called customer service and they, not my agent, faxed over the cancellation form.  Soon after I confirmed that it had been received.  On top of that I signed up for SMARTtrek for the additional discounts.  The agent told me that my CA account would transfer over to a NV account.  What she failed to tell me was this would not take place until my renewal was due in mid 2017.  So now because my accounts won't link I have zero online access related to anything to do with my account until that time.  So if I happen to get an alert I will be notified by email and have to call to find out what it is.  \n\nThe day I signed up for this policy the agent was celebrating her 25th anniversary with the company, so maybe her mind was elsewhere but as a customer these are not issues I should have had to waste my time calling to get answers to and dealing with customer service.  I have since transferred my account to a different agent.",

From the cashiers to the front desk operator, to the mortgage advisor, be certain that they'll try their best to help you out.\nLike most of us I've been using internet banking for a very long time, which means that there was no need for me to get to that office personally but when my debit card got charged by a Hong Kong company (via London) for some electronic goods that were paid for but never delivered I was forced to pay them a visit for a \"chargeback\". On producing all the relevant documentation supporting my case (email communication with that dodgy company asking for a refund, bank statements, etc.) the very efficient & professional front desk operator assured me that I'll get a full refund within 10 working days (through my debit card company) ... and I did...\nFull marks for them; keep up the good work!!!",

I have worked for banks for the past 6 years and have not received or given this level of service before. I am appalled to call these \"financial professionals\" colleagues. When I was finally seen by the Banker, I informed him of my discontent & he barely acknowledged it. He basically went on the offensive starting that I Needed to understand that they are all busy. I ended up closing my account due to this experience and his attitude.\n\nI also visited the Citibank branch just up the street(total different experience) & in less than 5 minutes I made a deposit and had my card ordered for expedited delivery in two business days.

He told me to minus the amount and send it in and that it should be ok, and that if the IRS had an issue we would deal with it later.  I am not comfortable with this and would like to send in a correct tax form.  I have called 3 times so far asking to have the taxes corrected and he has yet to call me back.

He genuinely cares about people and wants to educate them for success - whether that be with your insurance, your business, or even your personal life.  He has made helpful videos for all kinds of things!   \n\nJim reviewed my existing insurance and taught me many things that I didn't realize (where I was over insured or under insured)... and I appreciate his willingness to share his knowledge!!  \n\nJim is just an overall good person and I couldn't recommend him more.",

I have never had a problem and like the convenience of not having to wait in a line and I can go at any hour of the day or night. When I have been inside to speak with a personal banker, I have never seen lines though! The ATM takes checks as well cash for deposit with no use of a deposit slip. YAY! It is much more convenient to just put it in the ATM instead of having to fill out a deposit slip and dreading to lick the envelope. You can choose the option to print check images on your receipt if you feel weird about just sticking money in the ATM.  \n\nParking can be tight at certain times, but it is a busy shopping center.

A friend who runs a few businesses suggested I look at their services and pricing and see if it might be worth switching. This is a person who I trust implicitly about food, drink and music, so why not business services?\n\nUpon my first meeting with Cristina [the boss? I think, not sure. She has the air of a boss if that makes sense :p] I knew instantly I would switch over for one very simple reason:\n\nPassion.\n\nThat's right, passion. This lady is just plain nutty about numbers and hell bent on doing the best possible job she can. And it is clear how this impacts her work. I always try and bring this level of service to my customers, and I never felt this level of give-a-shit from previous bookkeepers. It has been extremely refreshing working with her. In the past three months I have:\n\n*Paid less for my bookkeeping services\n*Gotten vastly better service\n*Reduced overhead [a.k.a. increased profits] with a few cool tricks she brought to my attention [details that never seemed to catch the eye of my former firm]\n\nI have also recommended AccountingProse to just about everybody I know. The person who recommended to me is one of those extremely finicky people whose opinion I knew I could trust. Most of my friends see me the same way. \n\n\nI cannot suggest highly enough that you contact them and determine for yourself if you feel like you are being fully served by your present bookkeeper.",

Still constantly requesting same information. Loan was not closed within 30 days required on the buyers agreement and had to request extension to close. Went to exactly the last day and still nervous closing would not take place. Not a high risk by no means. Had a relocation package that was discussed from the very first conversation with Joe Fazio.

While I didn't end up finding the vehicle I wanted here, I was extremely impressed. Why?\n\nFirst of all, the philosophy is great! It's awesome to find a place that is open and honest about the car buying experience and is trying to change it to be more positive.\n\nSecondly, they only sell vehicles that they select and determine to be of worthwhile type and quality and they have a full-service shop on site to check the vehicles and also to provide any repairs that you might need later. They also told me that if you buy a vehicle, you get a lifetime discount at the shop for future repairs.\n\nThird, they list all of their vehicles on their website and the vehicles are actually there when you go to their location.\n\nFourth, the pitch was very low pressure. I was greeted by Ron who told me to look around and let him know if I wanted to take anything for a drive. The pricing is upfront and they have a folder in each car that includes the CarFax, recent sales prices of comparable vehicles, and other information about the car. It's clear that they stand behind what they sell.\n\nFifth, they guarantee that they will get you financed. I didn't end up selecting one of their vehicles, but considering a coworkers daughter just had to return a car after a month of driving it because the dealership they went to ended up not being able to arrange her financing, this is an excellent guarantee.\n\nIn sum, while its certainly an uphill battle trying to change the reputation of the used-car dealer, Auto Paradise of Arizona is bucking the trend and doing their best to do so. I would not hesitate to buy a vehicle here.",

Their prices are about the same as the larger dealers and certainly higher than Craigs list but Auto Paradise has checked the vehicles  over and their mechanic is very competent.  Rocky and Brett, the salesmen, are personable with no high pressure.",

    "text": "Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.\nThis review is the review of the insurance company only and does not involve any insurance agents.\nMy wife and I had never had nor been the fault of an auto accident since we received or first Vehicle Operators Permit some 46 yrs ago. I received an offer through the mail from Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. providing low rate premium coverage for drivers with a good driving record. After calling them I signed up for both auto and homeowners police's with them.\nAbout nine months into the policy my wife was involved in an accident. She went to visit family members who were passing through and staying at a local motel in town.  The motel was enclosed by a steel fence with only one entrance/exit gate.  The gate was a large, metal gate, with rollers that moved on a rail by electric power, controlled by a motion detector switch. If this switch detected something in the gate it would prevent the gate from moving until the obstacle was cleared. The gate malfunctioned and began closing while my wife was passing thru it and made contact with our new Mustang. The result was a good dent and paint scraped.\nWe submitted a claim and were contacted by a Liberty Mutual Appraisal Representative who did a damage appraisal. The rep directed us to take our car to a local repair shop that handles all their claims work and subsequently to a rental agency where Liberty had reserved a vehicle for us. The repair shop stated they needed the car for 3 to 3 1/2 weeks. The true outcome was 7 weeks. This involved many telephone calls to the repair shop manager.\nWhen the car was finished we went to drop off the rental and were told we had to pay the bill and give it to our insurance company for reimbursement. This became a heated argument lasting a couple of hours due mostly to the problem of trying to contact a Liberty rep to work the problem. When a Liberty rep was finally contacted we were asked to pay half of the amount and we would be reimbursed. Hesitantly we went along with the request prompted by exhaustion, and being famished and dehydrated.\nIt took up to a year to get reimbursed and they never got anywhere with the claim. They told us they couldn't get any cooperation with the motel management and turned the claim over to their recoupment department in an attempt to recoup their money through the courts. They suggested I file a claim with small claims court against the motel for the $1,000 deductible I was out.\nI never got my $1,000 deductible back and during this time my wife was involved in another accident. She was third in line at an intersection waiting on a red light when a motorist in a large pickup truck skidded into the back end of her car shoving her into the vehicle in front of her causing a dominoe effect.\nIt just so happened the driver was insured by Geico whose claim department contacted us and handled everything in a courteous, compassionate and professional manner. Our car was adequately repaired and my deductible was reimbursed.\nBy this time it was policy renewal period when I received a renewal notice and Bill with an explanation of expenses in the mail. The renewal fee was almost double in price of my original premium. I called the billing department and was given one lie after another not to mention the worst customer service ever experienced.\nFirst I was told the rate hike was for them to recoup the money they lost on the claims I filed. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. They doubled my rate for two no fault accidents. If you think about it there was really nothing a good defensive driver could have done to prevent a collision in those two accidents. When I tried to bring this up this rep went into ignorant mode and kept repeating her first response over and over in an attempt to prevent me from speaking.\nI wouldn't treat anyone like that and immediately became explosive under that abuse. I had to raise my voice to talk over her and demanded to know what their losses were in the last claim when Geico stepped up to the plate and paid for everything. I wanted to know why they didn't use the courts when they couldn't get cooperation from the motel at fault from our first claim. She responded by telling me they are forced to raise everyone's rates every year or two to help pay for all the claims causing them to lose money. I told her that didn't make any sense. I asked her why should you punish good drivers and make them pay for the poor drivers claims. I eventually told her that I would be calling back shortly with a date of termination of my policies. Before I could hang the phone up she responded by offering to reduce my rate  by $3.26. I guess this customer service master representing Liberty Mutual just had to have the last kick.  There is no way I can recommend Liberty Mutual to anyone. I can only hope that the time it took to write this review would be worth it if only it stopped one person from insuring with them.",

If they don't have a business customer in line, they'll take their non business accounts at the business window. No problem, that's great. But when I stand at the business line for 23 minutes behind a non business account and watch all of the employees including the banking manager standing around not taking me because I'm business. Here's there excuse. The non business lines don't have suitable change for businesses. I don't get much in change!!! Not even if I don't need change, they won't take me or any other business people. So then I start using the drive thru because I don't like the fact that they know you have a business to run and make me wait 20 minutes in the store. Well, I was told by the banking manager through the drive thru that I've been using 2 months when I don't need rolled coins in change that my change requests are too high (mind you, a hundred in $1 bills must be outrageous via the drivethru!!) and I can't do that anymore. She's never stopped me from doing that and I've been to other locations that loved when I did drive thru for change for work. Anyway. Long story short, take care of your business customers because chances are they're more than likely personal customers and more than likely moving every account they have (4!) to a different bank. Al because of one location and how they treat their customers. Loved this spot 5+ years ago but now it doesn't even deserve the 1.5 star they have on here.",

    "text": "UPDATE 3/23/2016:\n\nAfter IQTAXX sued me for defamation for this post, my lawyer filed an Anti-SLAPP motion.  At the hearing before the Eighth Judicial District Court, the judge granted my Anti-SLAPP Special Motion to Dismiss!  The case was dismissed with prejudice.  The court granted me my attorneys' fees, and even imposed damages of $1,000 \"to discourage plaintiff and other similar plaintiffs from filing SLAPP suits in the future.\" The judge agreed with my attorney and based his decision at least partly on statements that the anti-SLAPP law \"...is to ensure that lawsuits are not brought lightly against defendants for exercising their First Amendment rights\" and that \"consumer complaints ... do constitute matters of public concern.\"\n\nThe official order is still being drafted, but this is a resounding win for consumer reviews.  Before you decide to do business with IQTAXX consider whether you want to do business with a tax firm that will sue you for defamation if you write a negative review.  Looking at other reviews here, it appears that at least one more reviewer claims that they got a letter from a lawyer after writing a negative review.  If you get sued by IQTAXX, keep in mind that they already lost one SLAPP suit.  If you get sued by them as well, I would be glad to see if my attorneys will let me send you the documents from my case so that you can defend yourself against any infringements upon your First Amendment rights.\n\nUpdate 1/18/2016:\n\nToday I was served with notice of lawsuit by iQTAXX for slander and defamation, seeking damages \"...in excess of $10,000\" plus punitive damages, attorney fees and court costs for posting this factual review.\n\n\"The price was right\" for preparing a return. Now I have the IRS coming after me. When I call, I get a telephone call center that tells me the number is inactive. That makes no sense. Inactive numbers go to recordings: \"We're sorry, the number you've reached...\" not a live person at a call center. A week ago, the person who handled my 1040 said she would contact the IRS and call me.\n\nUpdate 11/3/15: \n\nToday I got, unsigned, a \"Cease and Desist Harassment\" letter via certified mail from a law firm about this Yelp review. Incidentally, the registered agent with the Nevada Secretary of State for that law firm is the same registered agent as iQTAXX as well as the same person as the only manager of record of iQTAXX. (This is public information available to anyone who knows how to search public records. Not slander. Not open for litigation.) I did \"cease and desist\" from (deleted) the one word they described in the letter as \"emotional rant,\" \"slander,\" \"unwanted and illegal conduct.\" They also mistook my above comment about having \"the IRS coming after me\" as being their fault, which was never my intent. It is fact. I did not imply or ever think that was their fault and have no idea why they inferred that. The problem was in not being available to honor their \"all-inclusive contract\" when the IRS did come after me.\n\nHere are the remaining facts, and why I STILL do not recommend iQTAXX to anyone under any circumstances:\n\nFACT: Fees for tax preparation at iQTAXX are all-inclusive, which is disclosed on their website and explained to clients at intake. According to the explanation I was given, this includes interaction with the IRS after filing.\n\nFACT: I was told by my tax preparer that she would file a hardship on my behalf. I signed a power of attorney which would allow her to file on my behalf.\n\nFACT: As of August 14, according to the Las Vegas Taxpayer Advocate Office, no hardship had ever been filed on my tax account.\n\nFACT: I put an unfavorable review on Yelp after the tax preparer didn't return my calls, mentioned above.\n\nFACT: The preparer finally returned my calls after I posted an unfavorable review. The first thing she said was that she saw the review on Yelp. She apologized that I thought I didn't get satisfactory service and asked me to please consider removing the review. She said they were having issues with their phone system. As I mentioned above, this does not sound plausible to me - opinion; I'm entitled; free speech, not slanderous and not open to litigation. Then she offered to help.\n\nFACT: Preparer said she had filed the hardship and that it does show on my IRS account, contrary to what the IRS employee told me. \n\nFACT: I spoke with another IRS agent on September 14 through their 800 number. He also said no hardship has ever been filed.",

    "text": "We took our Mazda into South Blvd AAA in July 2015, after it was jumped by a tow truck driver. Initially AAA had sent their \"battery specialist\" out who said there was absolutely no way to jump the battery and for me to just have one installed on site that he would sell me. After waiting 2 HOURS for this guy to arrive, he says he can't work on my car after all and it would have to go to the shop. I had a weird felling about this guy, and when he called an actual AAA tow truck, that guy was IMMEDIATELY able to jump it on-the-spot.  Was this first guy flatly lying to me to make a sell?  It certainly seemed like the only explanation.\n\nOnce at the shop, I went ahead and decided to replace the battery as it was getting weak- but as soon as I arrived home my car fell out of gear and would not shift into anything but neutral. Meaning it worked when I left the shop, and no longer worked 5 mins later, less than a mile from their location  I called and asked if they could look at it since something obviously happened when they worked on it.\n\nThey told me they would look at it -- for $99.\n\nIt is my opinion that something was done to the vehicle at the shop in order to generate more work for them. We immediately cancelled both our memberships.",

Call it in and more fees. This system forces you to walk into a store front so I guess they can upsell you. I'm like my word.... I'm not my grandparents. Let's just be real this set up caters to a certain population/generation. And guess what else... I may not be the target group but, \"Hello!!! We are here buying your membership.\" and I don't always want to be inconvenienced with a phone call and a trip when I can click and do it myself online. \n\n3) Only way to waive the fee, online, is to exchange $1000 USD to whatever. \nIncrement minimums are purchase at least $200 in USD so I asked for $100 in Euros and Krones. Well, I had to bump up because we didn't hit $100 after the exchange. So up to $106 and $102. \n\n4) The passport holder with RFID protection comes in nice colors but overpriced. I was okay with getting 1 because it was lime green but the kid found a nicer one in JCPenney for 2/3 less than what AAA charges their members. Well, JCP won. \n\n5) We were able to correct the Danish Krones to Norwegian Krones with a simple phone call and I still received my money the next business day.  Now, that's nice. They buy back whatever you have EXCEPT no coins. Beware: The 800# folks & online says it'll be 2 days. \n\nAll in all, I think the service is 5 stars as the ladies working here really want to help and make themselves available. \n0 stars for the antiquated process of all things in person\n3 stars for the options that are available \n3.5 stars for the exchange rate \n1 star for trying to always upsell.

The service department is rude, unhelpful and they have no idea what they are doing. First off I called and spoke to Ed, I have a Bison LQ horse trailer that is still under warranty. He said they did not take their warranty but would call and get charges approved and take a credit card. Bison said that was fine. I called again because I had another small fix and spoke to Rob. Rob said he was out Monday to bring it in Tuesday for both services. I had my mother take time out of her day to take it down for me since I work (which is clear across town). When she showed up Ed tells her he can't see her and she needs an appointment and he couldn't get it in until another week. One of the issues was my antenna broke and was hanging by wires from the top of the trail. Ed proceed to tell my 50+ year old mother to get up there and duck tape it. WTH??? So my mom makes an appointment to bring it back. My mother takes it back to the appointment she scheduled. Ed does not call Bison to get the charges approved or the credit card number from them. Instead has my mother pay $541 when she picks it up. I am so upset with the service I have received from them! I will NEVER take my trailer back to them nor will I buy a single thing from them again!\n\nIn looking at my bill, they said nothing was wrong with the antenna but still charged me $129 for it. It is clearly glued on an Ed saw it hanging by the wires just the week before.",

    "text": "This is the worst Camping world that I've ever been to and I've been to allot of them that I've lost count.  I decided to buy a trailer and Mike Walsh was the sales person.  It must had been my unluckiest day ever to have Mikes name up next as the sales person.  The sarcastic egotistic man needs to pull his head out of somewhere bad.  Then once I decided on what I wanted to buy, I had to deal with Mr Ashtray Paul in finance.  Paul the Finance Managers office smelt like everybody just got done with a smoke-out in his closed office.  I got home still choking.  Gag!!!  But what do you expect from a Gambling City?  I leaned my lesson the hard way.  All the Camping Workd misfits and rejects must get sent here to this location.  I told them I wanted a 20 year loan and both Mike and Paul agreed, but when I signed all the paperwork a bombshell was dropped at the end that it was a 10 year loan and at the end it would automatically be started over with another 10 years, so I signed and agreed.  But something bothered me a couple weeks later so I called I called the bank and found out that I had been lied to.  It was a 10 year loan and a balloon payment at the end, or you could re-apply for a loan and see if you still get approved.  Now I smell a gimmick and probably out to get more money and a higher interest rate.  So I immediately refinanced with someone I trust for the whole 20 year period.  Then, I had warranty work that I mostly pointed out before I took possession and that became a nightmare. They have several mikes and you constantly get transferred to the wrong one even though your specific which one you want.  It seems to be something that is done on purpose by the gals that answering the phones.  It gives the opertunity for the correct one to say \"I didn't get your voice message\".  These sin city gamblers are game players and play stupid.  They can never fix anything right the first time as if the mechanics are misfits just like the sales and finance manager.  This location should shut down completely and send all the business without the employees to the Henderson, Nevada location to handle.  And another sad thing about the Las Vegas location is when you buy a new trailer and want to buy things for it, their stock of items is horrible.  They don't even stock a complete set of anything in any color.  Like I said: Missfits.  I would like to say ithe hot weather is the problem, but I can't because Henderson Nevada is just as hot there and they are Great-Fantastic!  And then there is Jesse the Genderal Manager here at the Las Vegas location, who is just there without a clue of what he is suppose to do.  He just sits in his office pretending to be working and avoids handling any things.  Jesse is like the used salesman that never learned how to sell, but has the smile and Knod down, and makes promises that the problem your having is unacceptable and tells you that he will get to the bottom of it, and yet does nothing.  His title should be the Babble Manager.\n\nThe best advise that I can give you, is never get out of your vehicle and go in.  Drive-Drive away and go to a different location or another company that cares, because this Las Vegas lotion is horrible, the worst in sales, needed supplies stock, maintenance, management, and most important - customer satisfaction.  Please don't follow my mistakes.",

It takes time but squeezing someone in to correct an issue I would expect no less. \nI have spent some time there and watching and listening to the 2 service supervisors work, I think those guys do the best I've seen in awhile.

Despite the fact that we had an appointment made for this weeks ago he was told they might not be able to get to it that day! He told them he didn't need it that day and could pick it up the next day. They told him they would call when it was finished. That was Monday. He called yesterday (Black Friday) and no one answered. He called today and was told that it had not been serviced yet! No excuse for this! \nIf I could give negative stars to Campingworld's service department I would!",

    "text": "Update 2: We brought our class A in to get a tow package for the Smart Car. Everything went smoothly until the Roadmaster celanoid failed. Twice. Luckily the techs discovered it before we left the parking lot. John-John, Oscar and Denny refused to give up. Finally a good celanoid was delivered and everything works great. These guys went above and beyond for us. They spent hours showing us how to connect and disconnect the system. They went on a drive with us to show us how it works. These are awesome people! No complaints at all with the service department! Kudos to Mike for having a great team. \n\nUpdate: Since purchasing our new motor coach, we experienced several factory deficiencies in some areas. We were told by other owners, it doesn't matter if you spend $80g or $500 g, there will be kinks to work out. We had the toilet or some part of it break, three times, the dinette conversion bed was not properly constructed making sleeping on it dangerous and the whole entry door was crooked. All of these issues have been handled each time efficiently and professionally by the Camping World service department. While they don't like seeing us so often, we have come to know several employees by name and have a good relationship with them. The service manager Mike is awesome and makes every effort to get things done in a timely fashion. John Miller, PDI, knows so much as he used to work at the Thor factory and John, one of the technicians is extremely knowledgeable. We don't enjoy having to keep taking the thing back but it's so nice to be greeted warmly by our salesman, TJ and the other staff. My husband believes people in the service industry should be tipped whenever allowed and these folks are no different. A few bucks and a sincere thank you go a long way. We are looking forward to many road trips and adventures in our rv.",

When you go in there to make a deal with them - the first words that came out of his mouth was \"Be prepared to take a BIG loss.\" Seriously!? who starts off a negotiation like that.  He tried telling me the trade in value for  my 2016 travel trailer would \"depend\" on what I was buying.    That was the first flag.   Your trade in value should be your trade in value weather you buy something new or old.  Thats a classic sleezy salesman tactic of working it into their profits.     He told me originally the trailer I wanted was in the \"High30s.\"   When I told him I had a trade in, He changed the price to 49k for the trailer.     When I told him that was way too high of a price and I know what that trailer should go for - he lowered it to 35k within seconds!    So Ridicules.

For the tax filing she expects her clients to do her work which makes no sense since she is charging 300 per clients.  She was absolutely rude to me.  She seemed like she misses her filing to IRS.  She will try to rush you during your filing which is very annoying because you have no idea what is going on.   For that price i pay, at least she can treat the customer nicely.

We had donation receipts, other income, W2s, student loans, etc. I also had a list of bank statements that were itemized for other write offs. We spent a lot of money last year and also bought a home so I was anticipating to itemize some deductions. \n\nThe employee put in our documents in about 10-15 min. I think she asked me 5 times if I had any cash donations, which I did not. She never asked me about any other deductions. She then said we owed around $5000.00 for taxes. I have never paid this much in my life and considering we had bought a home I was not expecting this. \n\nI advised this was not acceptable and she had her manager come over and review what she had put in her system. The manager found one other small tax deduction for the home in the amount of about $200 and said everything was good to submit. I advised I would need to go through my documents and figure out if we had any other deductions because the amount was completely unreasonable. So, we left. \n\nI went home and that night, I went through Turbo Tax and sure enough found a TON of other deductions that were never even asked. These were deductions which were substantiated with receipts. So, I decided I would give The employee a chance to fix the return and called the next day. I was told The employee was with a client and that she would call me back. Did I ever get a call back. NO. I did not. \n\nI ended up taking all my information and deductions I found to Jackson Hewitt  and They helped me file my return. It took around 4 hours, YES.. .we have a lot tax items.

This year brought on several things I was unfamiliar with, as far as how to file correctly.\n\nPros-\n\n- These people are so friendly. Not your stereotypical cold, stuffy suits at all! Everyone from reception to the tax preparers were very genial and approachable. Spartak was the representative who assisted me and he was great!\n\n- If there are any questions or concerns at all, they have a whole team of professionals with varying strengths that all work together to get the right information. I had questions regarding gift taxes and when Spartak wanted to make sure his information was corrected, all he had to do was IM someone on his desktop and someone was at the desk in a jiffy! Great communication between everyone in their office!\n\n- They made a scan of all related forms/paperwork to my return and they keep it on file in the event that you should have any questions. They also neatly package your copies in a snazzy little folder for your own personal records.\n\nCons-\n\n- I had to wait for about a full hour after my appointed time....and I got there 15 minutes early. Ugh. After waiting 45-50 minutes, Spartak did come out, apologize for the wait, and said he'd be ready in 2 minutes...but then it was another 15-20 minutes till I saw him again! lol \n\n- If you want to have your preparation fee taken out of your refund, it is a $40 fee. I opted to just pay outright for my fee that day.\n\nFrom the information I gathered, they charge anywhere from $29-$169 for their services. With all the things involved in my return I was in the $169 club, but I still feel it was well worth it. \n\nI'm guessing the $29 fee is for a simple 1040EZ form. I'm shocked anybody would feel the need to pay to have someone fill out that simple 1 page form for them. I think I could tape a pen to my chihuahua's paw and he could manage to complete a 1040 EZ...but I digress..\n\nI referred a friend to them and he went in several days later. His return was a lot less \"involved\" than mine, so he only paid $119. So apparently there is some sort of pricing \"scale\"....\n\nOverall, this is a great service run by friendly and highly competent reps. I definitely give it a big ole' thumbs up!\n\n4.5 stars!",

I'm not that hard up for money that I would go back to get more crappy service. honestly I was frustrated.  Wouldn't u be? Then she proceeded to get me more frustrated by telling me that I never confirmed.  Well maybe they need to get their phones checked cuz apparently they can make calls but they can't receive calls. Cuz I called yesterday 3 times from a land line and 5 times today from a cell and all 8 times they picked up and they couldn't hear me. This happened to another customer while I was waiting because u can hear the receptionist \"hello? Iqtaxx. Hello??? Iqtaxx\" click.  So how is a customer supposed to confirm when their phones don't work???? And her parting line to me....now imagine this in the \u00bfitchiest tone possible....\"well we were going to do your taxes for free\". That just proved to me that I made the right decision to leave that place. At this point I don't care about the money.  I just want good customer service.  I don't want the other person on the other line getting \u00bfitchy with me just cuz I'm frustrated from their lack of service. Never ever going back. What a waste of time.  \n\n\nSo I arrived for my 6pm appoinment at 5:57pm....only to see that there were 4 ppl in line ahead of me for a 6pm appoinment as well....hhhmmmm....not a good start. One of my pet peeves....what the point of making an appoinment if u show up on time only to have to waste time waiting.  Gggrrrr\n\nSo at 6:35pm... there is a walk in...and she goes in right away!  I'm like WTH! I guess her taxes were simpler then mine by what she said but still she's goes in with no waiting....not cool when other ppl including me have been waiting.  So far my experience kind of sucks. \n\nAt 6:52pm I ask when am I going to be seen next as i have been waiting almost an hour at this point.  The girl at the receptionist desk tells me that the since my appoinment was not confirmed that they took me off the schedule.  I mean seriously she couldn't have told me this at the beginning when I checked in????? Then she tells me that the walk in at 6:35pm took the guy that was supposed to see me. Seriously?????? So even though I had an appoinment that they didn't confirm.....the walk in has precedence over me.  How is that right??????\n\nSo at 7:02pm. I left.  So yes this review is only in their crappy service.  I can't tell u how they did on my taxes as I hate having ppl waste my time.  What makes them think that their time is more important then mine?????? And seriously do they think that they are the only tax ppl around?",

The roof delaminated on the second trip. We made an appointment to bring it in. My husband talked to them 4 times before we brought it in. Then we took it in and they said we did not have an appointment . We have talked to keystone direct on the issue and tried to give them the contact who is aware of the roof defect. Nope camping world could care less who we talked to.  The only reason we used them now is they are the authorized keystone dealer. Stay away from this place if you can. Aug 31,2016",

    "text": "I purchased a high end Class A used diesel pusher from this Camping World in April 2011. I was upgrading from a Class C gas motorhome to this big diesel pusher. I knew very little about these larger motorhomes and kept asking lots of questions of the salesman, sales mgr, service mgr, \"diesel specialist\" salesman & location GM. \n\nMy biggest question had to do with what sort of fuel mileage I could expect. They ALL told me that I could expect to get 10-12+mpg. Well, after driving it for 2 years, at 55 mph MAX,  in all kinds of terrain, the motorhome averages 6 mph. Downhill, totally empty with the wind it might get 7mpg MAX. If they were just estimating the mpg for me, I might chalk up their bad advice to their IGNORANCE. However, unbeknownst to me when I bought the RV, it has a computer which tracks mpg of trips and for the life of the RV. It has averaged 6mpg before I bought it and after I bought it! So when I was asking all these RV specialists, not one of them showed me the computer and previous mileage history. They ALL continued to give me TOTALLY WRONG info. \n\nEither they are ALL totally ignorant- not knowing about the computer, which is std on big diesels, or they LIED to me. I know which one I think they are.\n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER buy anything from them again and I highly recommend you DO NOT do business with this group of liars.\n\nI give the 1 star only because the system won't allow 0 stars.",

And will transfer my current car loan as well, now that I have already transfered  my Visa and signature loans!  make sure before you join to look at all their fees there is a fee for everything even if your own savings account is your overdraft protection. there are transfer fees from your own accounts if you just want to transfer money, Do your homework. and find a better credit union, the raaising of fees has become an annual trend and is sure to continue to rise..  the general malaise of the  customer service agents is very disappointing. I'm sure it's due to all of the complaining that they must be getting as fees go up every year. it's great to belong to a credit union for such a long time and sad to have to leave it because it has lost that feeling of family.

    "text": "This review is for the Corporate Office. I purchase RV INSURANCE 2 years ago. Recently, it came up for renewal and I noticed a $60 increase for the 16ft travel trailer single axel. I flipped the back page of the policy and noted I was dinged as having an \" At fault accident\" last year. This accident was NOT AT FAULT as determined by my CAR INSURANCE PROVIDER,as well as,the police officer at the scene. I called my progressive agency and was immediately treated \"at fault.\" I was just about ready to go to the CALIFORNIA DMV & police department thinking one of them must have logged in this no fault accident to my credit. I called the reporting agency LEXIS NEXIS who Progressive states is their reporting company to ask for a print out. A few day later I get a credit report....... Ah? I didn't want this but, \"Thank you, I think\" I call LexisNexis again for the driving report and. LOW & BEHOLD ..... No at fault car accident to my credit.   A few day later, I received my bill for the 2nd premium with Progressive on the RV, after I had already cancelled the policy in writing & verbally, with my agent. \nToday I called Progressives 800 number to notify them again I have cancelled the policy and have s new provider ( paid in full) for my RV INSURANCE which is the same provider of my car insurance. Of course, \" Rashid\" asked me WHY I am cancelling and I basically, go in to all of the above explanation... I'm \"not AT FAULT\" says the POLICE REPORT, my car insurance and most likely the DMV. \"Rashid\" proceeded to explain to me that: Progressive labels you IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT FAULT, if the accident yields more than $1000. First of all, Progressive was never my car insurance, they never paid out, my car insurance gave me back my deductible after investigation and even progressives Reporting agency doesn't have that info... So who decided I was \"AT FAULT?\" Progressive- then they increased my RV RATE. So I dumped them and saved $60/year! \"Rashid\" was also condescending say,\" well I'm not going to explain it to you again . You are not listening.

We hired him last year to handle the bookkeeping, accounting and corporate/HST taxes for our small business.\n\nHowever, not long after he started working with us, things began to slide. He was unable to keep our books up to date or accurate and kept pushing us off for his other clients. We tried to be understanding, but it was incredibly unprofessional.\n\nAs we got further and further behind, it really began to affect our business because we couldn't make solid financial decisions. We had no financial data! Our accountant had completely fallen off the map! The person we trusted the most with our most precious part of the business was useless to us. We thought our finances were fine (based on what we could see in Quickbooks, that should have been current) and made a purchase decision that has now come back to haunt us, and jeopardize the stability of the company.\n\nPatrick was supposed to do our 2015 taxes (corporate, personal and HST). He got the personal ones done, but never provided us the paperwork for our records. He *started* on the corporate taxes, but never filed them OR the HST. It is now August 2016 and he has not filed ANYTHING for our company! It should have been done in December 2015. We now have penalties to pay to the CRA due to his negligence, and also higher fees from our new accountants to try and sort out his mess.\n\nWe have been so flexible and understanding with \"KH Financial\" and Patrick, however since December he has not been communicating with us at all. He doesn't respond to emails or phone calls anymore. We are desperate to get our finances in order because he basically ruined our company with his negligence. We trusted him. If he couldn't handle our business he should have told us much sooner, and cooperated with our new accountants rather than ghosting us like a bad date.\n\nWe are incredibly disappointed in him and his services. I didn't want to have to write this review, but it's just gotten to that point. I cannot in good conscience recommend Patrick Payne or KH Financial for any kind of business or personal service.",

Seeing as how they had amassed a pretty loyal following, i decided to give them a try. As you can tell from my rating above, I was very happy i did.\nPatrick came down to meet me right by my office, so i didn't lose any time in transit and was able to spend more time with him. Patrick took me through my return and my wife's return and arranged our expenses and claims in such a way so as to get the greatest benefit. He also spent a lot of time with me preparing me for the upcoming year. He talked me through all the things I should be preparing for as a newly self-employed person. He gave me some great advice and shared with me some useful software tools that will help me to keep track of my expenses throughout the year. Never once did Patrick look at his watch, he just sat and talked to me until all my questions were answered. He is a very friendly and professional accountant, who knows his stuff and also knows the value of great customer service.\nIt has been 10 days since my appointment with him and my tax return is already sitting in my bank account waiting to be spent!!\nI would highly recommend using KH Financial and i am even looking forward to the next tax-season (how many times have you ever said that in your life?)\n\nThanks Patrick, see you next year!",

First Fidelity is riding on the coat tails of Sunrise and Mesa Bank which were what they advertised \"Small Community Banks\". Worst customer service! Customers are treated with snotty, arrogant, employees that will bend over backwards to make your banking experience miserable! Don't be fooled by the staged community bank rhetoric when you sign up. You will soon discover that they charge for everything, they do not contact you personally if you have an issue, they are not secure with your money. If this is your bank, you need to grab your money and get out now!",

I've always deposit transferred money through the ATM machine without using a teller for better convenience or if I'm running short on time I've never had any issues with my money. Its always been available right there in there when it's deposit for all the years I've been banking with them!  this particular time with this branch I deposit my check and needed to pay some bills today and the check was held because I deposit my check through the ATM on this specific branch...? I went to go see a teller and they couldn help me with anything they said that the check will be held till Tuesday! They said that if I would have went to the teller and deposit my check I wouldn't have this problem I honestly don't understand the difference!  very discouraged and disappointed I would definitely never use this ATM to deposit cash or checks again don't need this inconvenience!",

Doesn't make sense to me , also can't understand how they can just close an account when a customer is never late on their bill and currenty as a zero balance.\nThey also tell me that their not required to refund a customer of their prorated annual fee .\nThey say they do random checks but, what about customers who are late which their bills and are allowed to keep their credit card . As I really don't need their credit card , it's that I'm trying to improve and by them closing my account for no reason , at least a reason that makes sense , it hurts a persons credit score.\nI would not recommend banking with Bank of America as they really don't seem to care and it's hard to find someone that can make a common sense decision. \nAs I said when my wife passed away I had trouble to handle a lot of things which I'm trying to correct but, Bank of America can't understand why a person would have problems. If they would just use common sense and see after my explanation that my trouble was when I suffered a tragic lost and now I'm correcting things .\nAs I said again and again , it's not that I'm applying for credit , it's I've been a customer of Bank of America for a long time and they don't care if their customer had issues that caused their score to drop and closed their credit account which just adds to hurting their customer even more.\nClosing my checking and savings account with Bank of America and opening an account with Chase Bank which after talking to Chase Bank I've found they use common sense and understand my situation.",

I deposited a large check yesterday and was informed that there would be 3 separate holds placed due to the large amount. According to the receipt I received, $200 would be available after overnight processing. The next amount would be credited after 2 business days, and the remainder after 7. This morning, I checked my account and somehow they managed to make my account close to 15k negative! I called customer service immediately and was informed they could do nothing and the branch was solely responsible. Here I sit, waiting for them to solve this mystery, and still I will have to wait to receive my money. Banks hold large amounts in the federal reserve for the interest they accrue. It only takes 24 hours for a local check to be transferred to the appropriate institution. While there have been regulations enforced to limit the hold time, this is ridiculous. Long story short, unless making a quick stop to use the ATM, avoid this branch altogether.",

The young man that helped me was soo nice, and so helpful. I've been in a tough spot recently so he doesn't even know how much he helped me with this particular transaction!

    "text": "FIRST OFF, the pictures to this place are designed to make you think that you are at a different place, for they are not pictures of the Check City on 4080 Paradise!  Deception!\n\nGo someplace else to cash your checks.  Here is my simple logic.  If you are going to get scammed by a company, taking 5% or better out of your check, do so with a company who hires employees that are happy working there.  The last thing I want to do is knowing I am getting scammed by a bully company and then get lip from some young girl who hates her job!  The young \"manager\" is rude and pushy.  \n\nAlso, do whatever you can NOT to USE WESTERN UNION.  They don't protect you if something gets lost in the mail as part of their service, for you need to pay extra for that.\n\nI wanted to pay rent by western union.  I gave 720 cash!  I sent the check and it was lost in the mail, so I had to pay a $30 fee to western union to get my money back in the form of a western union check made out to ME!  I went back to this place and explained what happened and they said they could cash the check for 3%.  Instead when I came back with the check, the young \"manager\" told me 5%.  I ended up being 38 bucks, so add that to the 30 fee and I was charged 68 bucks to get my money back after the check was lost in the mail!\n\nI love how everyone is a manager when it is convenient to be one.  You know how many times I have been to a dinky company like this and when I ask to speak to a manager they are all managers!  LOL, I will never go back into this place again!  \n\nI told the young woman \"manager\" that she could be doing anything in the world, so why the heck is she going to choose to work for a bully company, built on greed and deception.  I told her not to think that there were no consequences for her actions.  I told her that she would feel better working at a place where she was happy at!  Someplace where she didn't give the customers lip and she felt rewarded for the service she provided.  These type of businesses are opened by crooks.  No love in a business like this.\n\nTHIS PLACE IS A DUMP!\nI'm outta here!",

    "text": "Back in February my husband called Anthem to specifically ask who to use for his COPD supplies.  He was told Apria was in  network and to use them.  Then Anthem decided Apria wasn't in network and denied the claims.  Fortunately for us they had put in the \"notes\" that they told him Apria was in network.  That's when the fun started.  We paid the Apria bills then realized Anthem considered them out of network and Anthem did not pay anything.  In July we started calling Anthem, to find out why they were considering Apria out of network when they told us they were in network in February, always getting someone different, but to their credit, they did document all conversations in the \"notes\".  Of course we always got a different answer from everyone.  One rep told us we were owed over $800, and two different checks were being sent.  They never arrived.  Back on the phone.  Another rep said Apria had been paid and WE had to get Apria to pay us.  Really--for Anthem's mistake we now had to chase down Aprina--I think not.  It's now October and we are no closer to receiving the money owed.  We are now dealing with a supervisor, who says she will call back, but of course doesn't.  We went thru all the statements from Anthem and the bills from Apria--we now have a good idea what we are owed.  Guess what, the rep that said we were owed $800 was right!  Will we ever see the monies owed, yes!  We will keep on calling, on a daily basis if need be, until we get what is owed.  The next step is a letter to the Attorney General and the Insurance Board.  Anthem is holding our money.  If we owed Anthem money, we'd be in collections by now.  \n\nIn addition, we just received a letter raising premiums 20% and cutting benefits 20% for 2017.  We have Anthem Silver Pathway PPO individual insurance as we are both self-employed and not old enough for Medicare.",

I was completely honest 100% on the online application and like everyone else was pleased at the template quotation. A template because it means less than zero. After calling and being forwarded from one broker to another, i got a quote near 9 times higher. I do honestly believe that the broker was really trying to take advantage perhaps if my call got forwarded to someone else I may have received a quote for 4 or 5 times more.\nNo mortgage, no claims ever, no jewelry and asked for no more coverage in cash. After receiving the crazy quote by this sneaky salesman, I was told that there were a few things inaccurate about the online application. Really?? I said I had the print screen to show I answered the questions identically online to the questions over the phone. \nThanks very much for another online company who has our personal information we agreed to be shared (only way to proceed with the quote) and wasted our time and lied to.\nThis company is happy to sell your personal information, since that is what we had to agree to before they agreed that the quote was even a ballpark.\n\nPlease don't let the fake reviews change your opinion, its usually the common negative ones that truly reflect the truth.\n\nShame on you guys!",

LOL) However, if there is one thing that I love equally as much as shopping is saving money, because lets get real who doesn't like to save money...especially when shopping? \n \nRecently, I had the awful experience of being notified of a significant increase to my car insurance rates by my current insurance provider and I was wondering how I was going to come up with the extra money. I had heard of the company 'Kanetix' on the radio while driving in the car with a friend, and she highly recommended them. I just thought they had a funny name. She mentioned that her Dad told her about it after he used them to get cheaper car and travel insurance and had a great experience with them.\n \nAs usual, I went and checked Yelp to see if there were any reviews. There was one with only 1 star, but I decided to check them out for myself because my good friend and her Dad, that I trust, used Kanetix and said it was simply the best. \n \nNeedless to say, I went to their website and completed a \"Quote Comparison in 3 Easy Steps\". It was actually easy!! To my surprise after about 5ish min of filling out the application, I was given about 7 rates for my car insurance. After this, I called the number provided and was transferred through to the insurer. I ended up getting a new policy that was $235 cheaper!!! Meaning I now have $235 more to shop with ;)\n \nOverall, I would definitely recommend Kanetix!",

My bills were always paid late they could not figure out the schedule in which my bills needed to be paid in so I was constantly having overdrafts, etc. My taxes were done completely wrong and I had to pay a CPA to fix it all. \n\nUnfortunately, the owner, will never admit to any fault even though I have an email from her staff admitting to the mistake. They have caused me so many inconveniences and I still had to pay a fee to get out of the contract. Do not sign a contract with them! Horrible experience!",

    "text": "what a horrible experience! I was a solid customer for over 2 years. After canceling my insurance policy, making certain my account would not have funds been withdrawn I was dismayed to find that they were taken anyway. \n\nI called Allstate to let them know this, they promised they would be back in 48 hours. It's been a week and still NOTHING! (the lady on the other line was very nice I might add)\n\nBut it gets worse, because it wasn't returned when they said, I got an NSF fee of $36 by my bank. Oh joy.\n\nI call back a week later, was on hold for exactly 31:26 and then was told in order to get my $36 I'd have to fax them my info from my bank. Fax??? WTF, who has a fax machine in their house nowadays???  \n\nAfter all this hassle and headache you'd think the service rep would be nicer. Instead she kept telling me that it was company policy. I kept reminding her that her company policy had already caused me massive inconvenience and I could simply email her the info...that's what companies do in the 21st century lol. \n\nYou'd think she'd be a little more accommodating...but she was worse! I had to hang up the phone. \n\nSo I call my local agent, explain the situation, and he blames AllState. I reminded him that I bought the insurance from him, so he bears responsibility to get this resolved. He has been a little more helpful but so far no results.\n\nIt's been a week...where's my money Allstate????",

I did sign up with his company, and my first bill never showed up as Mr Hoffer's office made some mistakes on their part filling out paperwork on new policy.  I signed up for paperless billing and automatic withdrawal from my account.  I never received my paperless billing email, although they did take out 2 monthly payments, and then I received a demand for an additional premium of $250 per 6 months because of Hoffer's office making an error while setting up my account and putting in the incorrect email address. I called the office to try remedy the situation , and never received a call back, called his personal cell phone  ( He gave it to me, I was thinking I would get personalized service, I was very wrong to assume this, he clearly doesn't care about the customer much past the initial sale, but he sure conned me into signing up through his company, I actually paid an extra premium (about $400 for 6 month term)  to go with his company because I thought I was actually going to get the excellent service he told me he gives to all of his customers . so after about a week of not getting any calls back I went into his office and sat with him. explained to him where he made the mistakes and he agreed and said ok he'll get it straitened out.  after sitting with him in his office while he was on phone with the provider, he finally says that he can't do anything about it even though he made the mistake.  I finally talked to the same person he was talking to on the phone and we discussed the situation and the person at the insurance company agreed with me an actually fixed the problem and the issues with the additional premium.  Again no thanks to Mr Hoffer. he said there was nothing he could do, yet I talked to the exact same person on his phone in his office and she actually did something about it.   That was at the beginning of out relationship.  I have called and asked a few different questions about coverage's and other things over the last 5 months and I never receive a call back from him personally. He   has had his office people call me back, but while I had direct questions for him, He Never returned my calls, yet while I was shopping for new insurance , he amazingly returned every one he didn't answer promptly.  AGAIN DON\"T BE FOOLED BY A SLICK WILLIE SALES PERSON, HE OVER PROMISES AND UNDER DELIVERS....  Luckily I never had to deal with him on  a claim  I was fortunate in that respect. I am defiantly not renewing with his office a very poor office with terrible customer service when you need it, but amazing how helpful they are when they are trying to collect money from you...

    "text": "Honestly I like insurance agents as much as I like used car salesmen. HOWEVER..today we had an appointment with Jayson to go over our car insurance. We have had USAA for years and were recently given some information by a co-worker that had us looking into other insurances. We met at his office and he was awesome.  I was very impressed because he was honest with us and told us that for now, due to a fender bender 2 years ago, our best option is to stay with our current company.  He even took the time to go over our policies with us and called USAA to make changes that would benefit us..he even saved us $$$ and got us better coverage which I love! He made no money off us tonight but helped us tremendously. You can bet that next May, when our little accident falls off, we will be right back at Jayson's office making that change. If you are looking to make a change for the better in your insurance, you should definitely give Jayson a call!",

This branch made a mistake with paperwork several years ago on my dads accounts and no one ever knew until we had to add a signature card onto the account when my dad was sick.  Bank of America made the mistake but couldn't fix it without documents from a lawyer.  My family called the lawyer and he completed the paperwork and my mother made a 9am appointment (because that's when they open). They made her wait in the lobby for 30 minutes and even then she had to go back to the counter to ask why she was still waiting.  After meeting with the bank manager, Christina, she was told everything was in proper order.  Well, they again failed to do their job correctly and it wasn't until after my dad actually passed away that we found out they had messed it up again.  Now we are dealing with problems because of their gross mishandling of the account.  Instead of grieving my father we have been dealing with Bank of America to ensure my moms bills will still be paid...which they aren't because they have placed a hold on the account!  If I could leave no stars I would!  This is a terrible branch that is poorly managed and a company that is heartless.",

I decided to grab some coffee and sit down to work on my laptop. \n\nAt 2:21pm I get a call from the AAA guy, Ian, \"I'm next to your car\". Whoa, I walk outside and there's Ian, patiently waiting. I get out my spare and watch this dude change the tire in what felt like 2 minutes. He even checked the air pressure of the spare to make sure it was set for the road, luckily it was.

They asked the right questions and seemed knowledgable on not only nation tax issues, but also international which is very important for my business.\n\nBut then came reality, when trying to get a budget on how much services would cost monthly, I was met with such pushback. The idea that an accounting firm couldn't understand why a budget was important and needed is absurd to me. Many many emails back and forth, with multiple people from the company never answering any questions. \n\nFinally, after they filed for a tax extension (without my knowledge or consent) and sent me a $600 invoice, I decided it was well past the time to move on. The cherry on top: the reasoning they filed for an extension was because \"we were busier with larger clients that took priority over you\".

I called them and asked what happened to the dispute and they say 'oh that was denied'... I asked why I wasn't notified and they said they sent me a letter..not received.\n\nI now am on a payment plan with additional charges every month and a $30 installation fee for a $1079 bill... originally $289 \n\nIn a time of phone calls, emails, online payment systems, payment over the phone; RRFS corresponds with ticking time bomb snail mail and payment via cashier's checks only... \n\nIt's comically terrible and textbook extortion.

    "text": "My experience is exactly like everyone else on here who has been ripped off by Redrock Financial Services.  I had about $200 in HOA dues owing.  To make a long story short, the HOA sent my account to collections without proper notice and at the time of this writing the outstanding balance is $1,600 due to Redrock Financial Services, LLC.  That's about $1,400 in fees for about $200 in HOA assessments.  About $500 was tacked on after I informed Redrock that the amount was in dispute and I had an impending appearance scheduled before the HOA board.  Redrock also seems to want to make it as difficult as possible to communicate, i.e., I was required to fax them a letter, email was not acceptable.  Redrock is a foreign entity (registered in Delaware with a manager who lives in Florida).  From a brief search of the internet, it appears that Redrock has a long track record of unethical business practices in Nevada, and one of ripping off Nevada residents.  I will be checking with the Secretary of State's and the Attorney General's offices to see what steps need to be taken to rectify this on behalf of Nevada residents.",

When you buy a new trailer and are promised repairs are to be done you would think that they would be up front with you and tell you approximately how much time this would take.

Replacing a warped side panel and fixing the scratches on the interior ended up with staples on the walls and screws through to the outside panel. Mind you the sales man we worked with was wonderful but everything since then has been a nightmare. Went in to the store yesterday to check on the status of the repairs as they won't return calls with messages left, to be told by the repair person \"well it's useable \" seriously this is not what we were promised!

After the dealer that we bought it from failed to correct the issues after 4 tries that dealer said they would refuse to do any work on it warranty or otherwise. \nDutchman was shocked and sent us to Camping World in Avondale. We made an appointment and brought it in and 3 days later everything is corrected! They were GREAT to deal with. We had them install a tow package installed on our Chevy Equinox for towing behind our previous Motorhome several years ago also and that was great also.\nWho was that dealer we went through hell with prior to our great experience with Camping World of Avondale you ask?\nIt was Lifestyle RV in Mesa.\n\nWe highly recommend Camping World of Avondale!",

Parts were screwed up resulting in a week's delay, and I had to actually find the part number for them to reorder the part.  Parts were literally double the price of other sources.  I never received most of the calls they promised and getting information was like pulling teeth.  When the reordered part did finally arrive they failed to schedule my RV in the shop and the SERVICE MANAGER refused to come out and meet with me to discuss the situation.  I waited some time and he never appeared, just kept sending out excuses (the general manager did eventually fix the situation, more or less.)  Took 10 days for a 3 day repair and when we finally got so angry we just left the water heater still did not function.  6 Camping World techs worked on it for 5 hours and couldn't get it working.  (A couple of days later a 1 man repair shop in another town diagnosed it and repaired it in under 5 minutes.)  On the plus side they did provide us with a parking spot in their lot, saving us campground costs.  Unfortunately the promised shore power connection never materialized.

Agreed on a purchase price. Signed contract and put up earnest money. Was contacted by Elizabeth the finance lady to set up delivery for Friday and she sent an email which included the final paperwork to sign. I noticed it contained a different vin number than the one I had looked at. Luckily I had taken a picture of the vin while we were at dealership so I could get my insurance started. After bringing up the discrepancy in vin numbers, I was told no less than three times that I had been looking at the wrong number. At this point Jim Johnston became involved. He is the manager. Again, I must be an idiot, because I was told I looked at the wrong number. Turns out I was shown the same unit only four years newer. How was I supposed to know this. I would have looked at the other unit but never heard the magic word. The whole time this was going down it kept somehow being my mistake. The magic word is sorry. This is the straight up definition of bait and switch. Get a person hooked on something then all of a sudden that deal isn't available. Everyone did seem real excited to try and sell me a unit still.

    "text": "Our experience started out good. The salesman was knowledgable and friendly. Unfortunately, our good experience ended there. We bought our brand new camper in May. We took it out that weekend. The gray water tank leaked and the power converter wasn't working correctly. We understand there were going to be some glitches, so we brought it back to CW for diagnosis. They reported they would need to replace both the tank and the converter. Fine. They put it back together as they said it would take a while for the parts to come in. We were fine with that. We stayed at a site with full hook ups anyway. We went out one more time. We received a call asking to bring it back for the replacement parts to be installed the end of June. My husband brought it back and was told the converter was there, but the tank would be in July 11th and it could be picked up on the 13th. He called July 12th and was told the parts person we had been dealing with no longer worked there, so they had no idea what was going on. We then received a call stating the tank would be in on July 26th!!!! \nWe now have been making payments on a unit that we can't even use. My husband finally got someone on the phone July 12th and was told he would look into it and call back today (July 15th). No one called. My husband went down there to see what was going on. He told the service manager this was unacceptable that we have had our camper sitting there waiting on parts for this long. His response was, \"You and 52 other customers.\" WTF? Seriously???!!! At this point, I don't even want the stupid thing. Their communication is HORRIBLE. Plus, they are doing NOTHING to make this right. Shame on you, Camping World. For a company that supposedly has their customers' best interests in mind, you are failing miserably. I will be sure to warn others NOT to buy here. I would recommend Little Dealer Little Prices. They might be a bit more expensive, but it's worth avoiding the B.S.",

The experience was awful for the easiest sale of their month. They have no knowledge of the campers they are trying to sell. I had to google all the answers to the questions I had. The vin # model does not match the sticker on the camper, but no one seems to caste. The finance department is unresponsive, have to call over and over to get a call back. The delivery process is horrible. They barely told us how to use the brand new RV. Would have been nice to know the ins and outs and all the \"extras\" you need to buy before taking it off the lot. As a brand new camper, it should include very basic tools to use - or I should have been told I need to buy a black hose, before I got 3 hours away from Phoenix. Was promised that they would order missing pieces (from a brand new camper) that were broken, no response. Uneducated, no answers, clueless ... Please do yourself a favor and buy from another dealer. We wish we would have!",

Although I had been in their store, and they are generally very friendly,  I was surprised how friendly and accommodating the staff in the service department are. The service advisor that assisted me was Phillip Mayse and he took the time to closely listen to my issues and helped me resolve them. While listening to my issues he realized my travel trailer had another potential safety issue which he later had resolved by technician Derek  Wingate. Derek also was very helpful as he gave me advice as to what to watch for and how to resolve it. Being a relatively new RVer I really appreciated the help and advice. I will definitely return to Camping World and will definitely ask for Phillip.",

    "text": "What an extraordinarily horrible experience.  The trailer purchased in the spring has been in repairs since BEFORE Labor Day!  They have kept the trailer without ordering the parts. The parts are still not ordered as of today. The GM Tom Alexander states he will resolve this issue. He is unwilling to even look at the account while we are in the room with him. Fishy much? We are supposed to hear from him today. I asked for invoices as well and he tried to ignore my request.  There will be follow up postings. \nAnd by the way, i had to make a rating of one star in order for this to post....they deserve nothing currently.\n\n12/3/14\nUpdate as promised.  Received call back last night as promised by GM. Also received call this a.m. from Service Advisor, Darrell.  They are still \"looking into\" the issue. Two more weeks for the correct tent fabric, sigh. No up date on side panels, diamond plating and hot water heater issue. Keep in mind people....this trailer only went back to this dealer because of a warped side panel!  Purchased in April 2014,  used ONCE, and it has been back at dealer since. It took a MONTH to get appointment to get it in. And she has been there ever since.  Love paying on something we don't get to use. Love making plans and scheduling time off for hunting when the dealer can't seem to fix one issue and then poor staffing creates many problems. What will the dealer do for us? How will he compensate all the time, money and emotions that have been expended?",

And by far, Daniel is the best.\n\nHe is prompt and accountable (harhar) with his correspondence.  I prefer communicating via email and Daniel usually responds within hours - making sure to address any concerns and clearly shows his excellent tax knowledge and his understanding of my tax situation.  In fact, he made a couple of suggestions to help lessen my tax burden in the future -- things that never occurred to me... and were never brought up previous tax professionals seeming more interested to get your taxes done (sometimes by a subcontractor) and move onto the next client.\n\nAlso, it's nice having a tech-savvy accountant in Daniel -- I didn't have to explain why my files 'weren't opening', I didn't need to 'follow-up' and we didn't need to kill a forest with hardcopies of everything.  Most everything was handled over email/cloud storage and we only met to handle some unavoidable paperwork at his Yonge & Eglington office.  In fact, even our meeting was productive as Daniel really took the time to understand my situation.\n\nOn top of being thorough and compassionate, his rates are reasonable and fair price for the peace of mind and excellent advice he provided.  This was the first year that I went to Daniel with my taxes and I will definitely be working with him in the future.",

Well when it came time to disburse the funds they didn't pay off the garbage company lien.  Complete incompetence if you ask me! Now we can't start up our new service with the garbage company until this is resolved (and we're getting farther behind every month that goes by).  When notified of the error, they offered to pay half and we pay half rather than file a claim with their insurance company (or just pay it themselves to avoid a claim!).  If we don't accept that, we were told we could get a lawyer, but that we'd signed the paperwork so it was OUR fault.  Um, yea...the paperwork that YOU prepared for us to sign.  If you omitted the garbage lien from those documents, then you should be willing to fix your mistake...it's what you do...research and prepare title documents!  WHAT!?  I already paid over a $1000 for title insurance!!!  For just this kind of circumstance.  Well, the jokes on them--we'll take their half and pay ours, but then we'll be filing with the state agency that oversees/regulates title companies.  Not to mention letting others know to avoid dealing with them, or at the very least to check and double check that all the liens were listed to be paid off in escrow.  If you're an agent that uses them...maybe think twice about that too.  Even our realtor couldn't get them to do the right thing for us.  Shameful!",

Going to the bank should never be comparable to the DMV and this one was worse than that.\nThe bank was busy during our visit and they only had one person at the window. Makes no sense. So after a 30 min wait once we get to the window, we are told an additional step needs to be completed (took 30 secs), fine. What is not fine, is being told that we cannot go back to the window when done and would have to stand in line all over again.\nI have never been to a business, whether it's a bank, or a post office, EVEN the DMV when you are told to go to the end of the line when you are ask to complete something additional. \nSo after another 30 minute wait, another employee (finally opened a second window) confirmed that sending customers at the back of the line after they've already been on line is their regular practice. \nSo, if you enjoy standing in line twice, totaling an hour for a simple transaction, this is the bank for you.",

    "text": "My husband and I contracted this office to help with a bankruptcy.  The experience with Charles was undulating, tending toward negative.\n\nWe first met him a few years back when he was at his own office somewhere in uptown.  His services are clearly popular, because there were a lot of people waiting to see him.  The office was organized and well-staffed, which was a good first impression.  However, what was disconcerting was the receptionist at the time.  Her desk was in the open, which meant that when she took calls from customers who were asking questions, you could hear the details of the discussions.  I have never worked with a bankruptcy attorney before, but I would think, for confidentiality purposes, these are discussions you would have away from the general public.\n\nWe actually never got to meet Charles, because I think he had paralegals handling the filing.  That's who we worked with.  Overall, the impression was more positive than negative, so we were pleased.\n\nDue to several family issues, we couldn't start the bankruptcy until a year later.  We had made the necessary payments, minus the filing fee.  So we didn't see him until sometime later to move forward.  He had moved to his own office in a nice part of town; his office was very nice, much nicer than his last.  Unfortunately, this is when our experiences took a nosedive.\n\nHe worked with us to complete the paperwork, but I found this process to be unnecessarily complicated.  On one occasion, he forgot to have us sign a form, so we had to travel down to the office to complete something that could have been handled with the other documents.\n\nWhere the relationship took a steeper nosedive was when it came to following up with him if we had questions about the bankruptcy.  He was an incredibly difficult person to get in contact with.  We would leave multiple messages for him, and it would take him up to a week to return the call.  My thought was that he could have sent a text message or e-mail, or he could have left a quick voice mail letting us know that he got our messages and would get back in contact with us at some point in the future.  No, it was a waiting game with him.  This was certainly a point of frustration with him and his services.\n\nWhat was jarring was what happened next.  When we got to our meeting of the creditors, we were in the waiting room and noticed that the attorneys for everyone else who was waiting were showing up and rehearsing the meeting to calm noticeable jitters and make the process easy for both the clients and court.  This was a professional approach.  Five minutes before we were all supposed to go into the court, Charles still had not shown up.  My husband called him and, shockingly, reached him on the phone.  We confirmed that he was still coming, and his response flabbergasting:\n\nHE HAD FORGOTTEN OUR MEETING WAS THAT DAY; HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE FOLLOWING WEEK!\n\nHe said he would \"speed\" down to the court after he gathered our paperwork.  Thirty minutes later, he walked in.  Thank goodness we were penultimate in our meeting, because had we been first, we got the impression that the judge would have rescheduled us, which would have been a problem, considering it was hard enough for my husband to take time off work.\n\nWhen he did show up, he handled himself professionally and answered all the questions that were asked.\n\nFast-forward two  months to December.  We took a call from a creditor who was supposed to be included in the bankruptcy, and it was from that creditor that we were told that our bankruptcy case had been dismissed!  We called the courts to determine the reason for the dismissal, and we were told that a particular form had not been filed even though the courts sent out multiple notifications to Charles that the form was needed.  We called Charles, and, of course, he returned our call after three or four days.  He stated that he had filed the form and wasn't sure why the courts never got it.  Frankly, I didn't believe him.  Considering the courts stated that they sent multiple notifications to have the form completed, one would think that Charles would have responded to at least one of those requests.  Nonetheless, he responded, and the case was reopened.\n\nThe discharge happened approximately a month later, which was a relief.  Fast-forward two months to today, and we are having considerable issues cleaning up our credit report with creditors.  Several creditors stated that they needed a schedule of accounts to show that they were explicitly included in the bankruptcy, which sounds reasonable to me.  At present, it's been one week of multiple messages having been left at his office and on his cell phone, and we still have not heard from him.  The courts stated that the attorney has to provide this information.  We have no reason to believe we will hear from him again.\n\nThis was an overall poor experience.  I would encourage potential customers to seek bankruptcy assistance elsewhere.",

My wife and I went to centennial toyota to buy a 4 Runner and we new what exactly we should pay and the salesman tried to give us a run around and tried to tell us the price we wanted was not possible. We new the price we were wanting was the fair price and was what we could get going thru Costco. So we told the salesman thanks but no thanks and after a sarcastic statement from him I knew we were doing the right thing to leave this poorly run car dealer and go elsewhere. We went to the next closest dealer where we were treated very well and given the exact deal we new we should get. Bottom line do not use Centennial Toyota without checking with one of the other dealers to make sure these rude, sarcastic, unappreciative idiots are not trying to rip you off.",

    "text": "I bought a Tundra from this dealership and traded in a Ford F150 in the process (mistake).  The tundra needed tires and I brought that up and was given the same solution as other buyers that once another truck came in with identical tires they would be able to swap them out. I guess I was dumb enough to go for that. So I take the truck home. The breaks are so bad the truck feels like it's gonna fall apart when I use them. I also have a small exhaust leak forming after the first day of driving. So I take it back for service the very next day. I mention those issues on top of a AC vent that just will not adjust, it's broken. So they address the issues and I get a call that I would need to pay for a replacement AC vent and that they found an issue with the drive shaft that it was grinding on something. So I go in to pay for these repairs even though I just bought this truck the day before. But the service department was actually good and I really didn't pay for anything even though I was stuck with the broken vent the essentials were taken care of. So I keep calling on these tires because they are bad enough to were I don't feel safe driving on them. Same story over and over even though I hear all these tire deals going on at the dealership, still nothing. So I buy this \"certified used\" truck with all these problems but then it's my fault they are broken and I end up paying for new tires out of my own pocket. I have been working overtime at work just so I can trade this truck in and get another Ford. I will never own another Toyota ever again. I will boycott the name and pass the word to friends and family of this horrible experience.",

Once there I was informed I couldn't look at the car because the general manager was driving it and had taken it home for the day.  I set up an appointment to see the car another day.  \n\nWhen I arrived to see the car I was told I could only look at it for 10 minutes because the manager had a meeting and needed the car.  So we quickly looked in the car to find it was obviously used/driven.  Personal items were still in the vehicle and it was not clean. There wasn't an MSRP sticker.  The odometer read 650+ miles  I should have left at this point, but I still liked the car so we headed in to negotiate.  I figured they couldn't expect me to pay full price for an obviously used car.  I briefly spoke with the general manager on the way in, who informed me that he routinely drives a lot of the cars from the lot until they reach 5,000-8000 miles.   \n\nFirst they offered $3000 less than NADA and Kelley Blue book trade in for my car.  Second they hand me a piece of paper with a price that was $2000 more than MSRP and what their website said.  I mentioned that I have used the Costco auto buying program in the past and would like to see if they could match it (Costco guarantees invoice pricing on new cars).  I have purchased 3 cars in the last 5 years through the Costco program or by mentioning it and having the dealership match their price.  The sales manager comes back and says he can lower the price, which ended up being the MSRP/advertised price on the internet.   I reminded the sales manager that this car is no longer new (650 miles), he stated this was as low as they could go, the general manager would not approve any lower price.  What a joke......  I guess the general manager was more concerned about driving a nice car rather than selling a nice car.  The real loser is the salesman, because I will go elsewhere and buy the vehicle, the general manager will continue to drive that vehicle and the salesman missed out on a sale.",

    "text": "Called my service rep (Tom B.) at Toyota 3 times this week to have my car serviced for this morning 3/28/2015.  No return call.  Called a 4th time and left a message on Tom's answering machine telling him that I would come in at 0730 on 3/28/2015 unless he called to tell me otherwise.  Still no call back.  When I pulled up to Toyota at 0730 this morning I saw Tom.  Tom passed by me without a greeting and he called out to another service agent (Douglas F.) who was passing by and stated, \"You take care of her.  She doesn't have an appointment with me.  You take care of her.\"  Tom was motioning as if he was trying to shew a fly as he spoke.  Douglas was confused and I was humiliated.  I told Douglas that Tom was being nasty due to events from my last visit and that I needed to speak with a manager.  ALL I DID WAS STEP OUT OF MY CAR (I HAD NOT SAID A WORD) AND TOM HUMILIATED ME.  \n\nI spoke with Oscar M. who seemed very upset by Tom's actions.  I told Oscar that if Tom was to no longer be my service agent I should have been assigned a new service agent at my last visit rather than go through the humiliation that I went through this morning.  The good news is that this morning Douglas was assigned as my new service agent.\n\nTo be REFUSED SERVICE (initially) by an organization as big as TOYOTA is shocking.  Is Tom that valuable an employee that he felt EMPOWERED to provide follow-up service that was worse than the last?  Because CENTENNIAL TOYOTA is the only Toyota dealership near my home I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER TOYOTA in order to eventually end having to go to that dealership.  I hope Tom is worth losing customer.  My next car would have been a TOYOTA or LEXUS, but not anymore.  I want to get as far away from this dealership as I can.\n\nThank you Douglas and Oscar for your kindness. \n\n\nToyota, I post my experiences on FACEBOOK, TWITTER, INSTAGRAM, BLOG, YOUTUBE, ETC. ETC. ETC......\n\nThis is an update that FINDLAY TOYOTA employees are much nicer, the dealership is much nicer, and they are kind to their customers.  I drive 45 minutes to get to it when Centennial Toyota is 5 minutes form my house.  Looking forward to changing my car brand.",

    "text": "oh CENTENNIAL CENTENNIAL CENTENNIAL.. how have 'ye disappointment me. \n\nThey were my first choice, go figure. \n\nI knew what I wanted, done my full research on the vehicle of my choice, only to be lured by the 2013 Rav4 Limited Edition situated perfectly between myself and the papers for the Toyota Corolla I intended to purchase. \n\nAfter a couple of days of conversation with Peter Cornish's assistant John. I was to come down with my trade in to get a new vehicle. John was very nice and oblige to my request of more quotes on different vehicles/models etc. I was sold.. until it was love @ first sight with the Barcelona Red herself. Unfortunately, John couldn't be there when I was to arrived, but I appreciated the phone call and still went ahead. I was told to ask for Glen, the internet manager. Upon arrival, I was greeted at the front and when I asked for Glen.. I was shuffled to a salesman.. I don't remember his name, but it started with a V. When asked to sign something that which would state that if we come up with the figures.. don't know who 'we' was.. that I was going to take the car. I politely declined and asked him to get me pricing on both the Corolla & the Rav, to which he was actually having me pick one or the other instead of doing the workup on both. \n\nSOLD - The figures came back at a not much more of a difference a month... I was sold on the Rav.. Shook the salesman's hand.. then \"GLEN\" finally came over and shook my hand in gratitude for doing the deal at CENTENNIAL. The finance team was working up the paper and I asked the salesman to show me some of the 'bells and whistle' in the Rav only to hear Glenn's voice claim that he cannot get me financed at the monthly figure we shook hands on. That he had made a mistake. I understand that mistakes happen, but not at the caliber of me thinking I'm in a new car only to get the rug pulled from under me and while still pinning me down.  They tacked on an extra $200 a month.. and asked for more $ down. I was in disbelief. LOTS of back and forth happened. I even agreed to a different deal which would have been more $ down, and more on my monthly payment, with an extra year - only to come to where the salesman asked for my trade in title, from which in earlier negotiation he mentioned that the were only to give me $1k for my 2000 BMW trade, in which I mentioned that I'd rather keep the vehicle for that amount. Apparently, he didn't get that. \n\nWe endured a ridiculous 3 hours at the dealership only to walk out in disbelief. Another \"manager\" came up and referred back to my initial interest on the Corolla, which had the payments I wanted in the first place, but I politely told them that if I was to buy a Toyota.. It wouldn't be at CENTENNIAL and walked away to another dealership the next day and happily purchased.",

    "text": "I thought about this one because I'm very skeptical about salespeople in general-- especially car and service salesman, but this experience was surprising to me.  I'd like to give kudos especially to Quincy Mosley who works as a sales advisor for Centennial Toyota.  Not only did he direct us to do what we needed, he didn't push hard.  Now, mind you he did push but that's his job and I understood that.  I brought my girlfriend's truck in for service and Quincy was the only sales advisor who walked up to me and asked me what I needed.  He answered all my questions even when I kept coming back.  One of the service porters also did try to help me also.  The receptionist just sat at her computer and didn't once ask me if I needed help.\n\nAs much money as all dealership service departments charge, I'd expect everyone to show a little more initiative when someone peering into their window walks up looking confused (me!).  I walked into the car show room and looked around a bit and I expected to be approached by a car salesman but no, not one! No one asked if I needed any help or anything.  Maybe it was the case of the Mondays, but am I wrong?  For a place that relies on great customer service to get paid, their customer service as a whole wasn't very servicing at all! :( If it wasn't for Quincy Mosley, I'd give this dealership 1-2 stars.",

    "text": "This is the second vehicle purchased here, very happy with both.  Raul was very professional and helpful.  What I appreciated was he gave me times to mull over the idea in my mind as he quietly let me finish my train of thought at various points throughout the process of getting a new car. Lots of sales guys just talk the leg off a wooden duck, so this experience was quite refreshing.  In the end I drove home a 2017 camry that I just love.  The grill looks alot like a Lexus for a whole lot less which is actually what sold me the car, so I sincerely appreciated Rauls style of letting the car sell itself.  I jumped in and the car just felt quality including the leather accents, then I notice the red threads that MAKE the interior... test drive and you'll see what I mean!  Start to finish I think I was out of the dealership in about 2.5 hours, only making this one trip to the dealership before I was driving home happy!  Thanks again to everyone who helped out!",

    "text": "I decided to buy a battery from Toyota rather than another parts store.  It wasn't worth it.  The battery is good the price is a bit high, but the service was poor. I went to the parts department after calling to see if they had the battery I needed and waited for some time.   One fella asked if I needed help but once he found out that another employee has spoke with me on the phone he left me to stand in line. When the clerk assisted me he simply went back and sat the battery on the counter gave me a slip and said \"go over to the cashier.   He didn't say hello he gave me the part got his commission and sat down. The cashier is the only reason I didn't give this place one star. She was very present and nice to talk to. She offered me some advice on the warranty and sent me on my way. At this point I have a new battery, a car with a dead battery and no way to install it.  Long story short,  they would not install the battery or give me the tools to do it.  They would set up a ticket and charge me to have their shop install it, because \"we don't do work for free\". I did get the job done on own. Please , go to any other retailer to get a battery.   They are 10-30% cheaper and most of them will install it even Walmart.",

We were horrified to find out how bad the tire is and how extremely dangerous for us to drive the car. If thats the case, howcome this toyota service center failed to inform us of this situation infact they even offered to just rotate the tires!!! Why would you rotate the tires if their already that bad?? \nSo after my wfound out abt this,we went to talk to the manager of this place who obviously dont want to listen to us and did even seem to care about what happen. He even told us that there is no camera to prove our claim, and even give us a lecture abt bringing the car for service. Dont go here for maintenance and service of your car,its a tital waste of money!!!and  If you value your life dont go to this place..as long as you pay them..who cares whatever happen to you , your family and your car.",

    "text": "These guys at Centennial Toyota are \"old-school\" sleazy bags you see in movies...  Seeing them actually in action in real life was such a surreal experience.  My wife and I decided to test-drive a Toyota.  A sales guy (Joseph) was polite and nice initially.  Test-driving went great, and I told him, \"Thanks for letting us test-drive the car... I'll call you after I do some shopping around.\"  Joseph insisted that we see the \"numbers\" inside their office, and it would take only a few minutes.  Okay.  Nothing to lose, and I wanted to see what prices they would give us (more specifically, how much off the sticker price).  Little did I know there would be these sleazy \"psychological\" high-pressure sales tactics.  First, this initially nice salesman Joseph guy would take good 30 minutes talking to this manager and that manager to give me the \"best\" deal.  Second, this guy Joseph, who's in his late 20s/early 30s would use \"old-school\" high pressure sales tactics as if he was hell-bent on closing the deal right there and then.  Look, we gotta go home; we came here just to test drive!!  \"Why would you not close the deal today?  I just wanna know.\" \"Because I want to shop around!  If I get a better deal at another dealership, I want to know whether you'll match that!\"  \"So you are going to pit one dealership against another.\"  HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT.  THAT I WAS GOING TO PIT ONE DEALERSHIP AGAINST ANOTHER, by shopping around!  Really?  These guys actually exist?  This is just my imagination but not really off base; these guys at this dealership, upon reading this review of mine, would probably go pat pat Joseph on the back and say, \"Hey, this sucker wrote about you, and, you know what, you did exactly as we taught you.\"  Unbelievable...",

When I brought up the truecar average price for the car he said, \"what is truecar?\" I made the mistake of telling them I had a preapproval for a certain amount and they wouldn't work with me on any numbers until I started looking at financing through them.

    "text": "Centennial Toyota has been our go to spot for car shopping for years. My family got a total of four cars from them (one lease) and while the salespeople are usually polite and not very pushy, the price you get might not be great and the service for the few visits i personally had were pretty horrendous.\n\nMy recent experience at Toyota was less than pleasant though. It was a big waste of time. I convinced my girlfriend and her sister to check out centennial toyota simply because my history with them and naturally i expected a rather fantastic quote from them. I did my research and called several dealership as well as printed the true price paper from U.S news cars website, I even had a friend who sent me their receipt from Henderson toyota for the exactly the same car. \n\nI started off by letting my gf test drive the car and then the scary negotiation begins. The salesperson was very polite but let me say my previous purchase and my loyalty played absolutely no part in the negotiation process. I was quoted $3000 more than the true car pricing gotten off of the cars website and about $3500 more than what our friend got at Henderson. What bothers me the most is that the salesperson kept asking for my bottom line. It's safe to say that he missed the point, he was playing the bargaining game with me and I just wanted a hassle-free experience. After we told him we will visit another dealership and my gf's mom has to co-sign with her on the car even if we buy it right now, he looked dismayed and became obviously less excited about us. He somewhat hastily ended the conversation and gave us a not so great price written on the back of his business card and we left very unsatisfied. He never mentioned anything about the $25 test drive gift card btw even though I showed him the coupon that they sent us. The whole thing took almost two hours.\n\nWe went straight to fletcher jones afterward, and guess what, we bought our car there the same day. Their initial offer and the only offer for the same car beats the Centennial quote by around $4000 and the recent graduate discount was $750 vs. $500 from centennial. Yes, the cars were exactly the same with door protector being the only difference. We had NO negotiation because we felt the price was great and all of us were surprised how easy it was. With signing and everything it took about 3 hours total. \n\nCentennial later sent me an email after I told them my disappointment. The manager simply told me that I should've just called them and that they will not be beaten by any body on price. That's completely missing the point. If they offered me a good price and played no bargaining game with me in the first place, I would probably spent a little more to save the trouble. It's safe to say my loyalty with this place is completely gone. \n\nWill I go back to Centennial Toyota? Probably, since buying a car is all about playing these games. I am not sure if buying at Fletcher Jones can as easy as this one. But will I ever convince somebody to go to Centennial simply because my so called \"Loyalty\", absolutely not. There is no loyalty, at least not with what happened to me.",

They been calling and sending me emails about deals. \n\nI was excited at first, So MLK i been doing research on The New Camry 2017. I and i decided to trade my old one. I already read reviews about this dealership that how horrible they are and how inconsiderate.\nBut i still gave them a chance.\n\nWent there at around 11am in the morning of 1/16/2017. Prior to that i been talking to Tyler Lavin the Sales Person. I told him the features of the Car that i want. \n\nWhen i came in they run everything, Credit i had to ask my sister to cosign for better credit so she did help me on this. And i told the sales person. Check my car they valued it etc.\nI told them My wants 389.99 same car payments etc... we end up at 409.29, i told can you give me few minutes i need to visit a friend in the hospital (Centennial Hospital and think in 20 minutes.) \n\nSo i came back to them and Guess what they did not honor the 409.29 deal they jacked it up to 429.09 and the higher guy i forgot the name is Rude and Disrespectful at Customers\n\nI am so mad that the reason they gave me because my car has a damage they said? What i told them you check and tested it isnt it? And now your telling me it has a damaged?\nThats why i waited 3 hrs for that. Now at around 6:30pm, I walked out so mad. \n\nTyler and those people Doesn't even care at all and don't give any concern. Thinking i waited for like 7.5hrs. \n\nNow at around 6:40 i walked out so upset and mad, This salesperson Burnham came in and ask me whats wrong told him situation. He helped me, Note Burnham is very professional and respectful and He is very Helpful. Explains better than other sales person here\nAt around 7:00pm finally we agreed to have sales including \n\nGap Insurance, \n0 % for 72 months.. \nNo Downpayment\n\nWaited for my sister at 7:30pm we finish all paperwork at 8:00pm, Then they told us we can get the car for some reasons etc.. cause my credit score was not high / good. They told us to call at 8am\n\nBut isn't that They Check me already at 2:-4pm i waited?  I am still positive on this\n\nSo we went home, Waited at around 11am no call still finally i Called them and guess what They said I am not approved etc etc... and they said i cant be approved and they will change the rate and offer to another bank? And change the price?\n\nSo With this Experience I am sharing it to you and you decide, If you wanna come to this dealership. The sales person are not Professional and Don't care at you at all. They don't have Honor and Intergrity. \nThey change stuffs easily they will put you in a bad situation.\n\nYou will waste your time and effort on this Dealership I WILL Not recommend this!\n\nAnd please stay away from this dealership they are so many dealership in the area...\nI gave them chance but i had my bad experience.. \n\nPlease stay Away from this Company / Dealership",

    "text": "As I sit here waiting for my car service to be completed, I figured I might as well write a review of this place.\n\nI bought my Camry Hybrid here in March 2007 and I've been taking it here for service ever since. It's a long, long drive, especially since I no longer live in Summerlin, but I like taking it here for some strange reason. I think it's a combination of the friendly staff, the free donuts and coffee/hot chocolate machine, and just the overall invitingness (is that a word?) of the location.\n\nEven better, they now have e-mail notifications. I usually know that my car is done way before Jason (my service guy) comes to find me. Oh and they have these three computers for you to use the Interwebs.\n\nOverall, I had a good car buying experience here 3.5 years ago (I used their Internet/Fleet department), and I continue to enjoy their service. I probably spend more on service than I could at places like Jiffy Lube, but I'd just rather take my car to a Toyota dealer because it's a hybrid.",

    "text": "Please take this review very seriously when considering buying a car from this place... they have cost me nearly $10k and offered me $900 as a trade in for a car they'd sold me only 2 months prior for $7500. I purchased a used Corolla on 10/22/15, the car had only 80k miles on it (roughly) for $7500 (tax&fees brought it up to well over $8k). On 12/23/15 the serpentine belt fell off which can be very dangerous when you are driving (you lose power steering). I took it to Findlay Toyota and was informed the bolt holding the belt had broken and was lost in the engine. I agreed to pay nearly $1k to have the work done, but when they completed it they informed me the engine was knocking and would need to be replaced. This would cost $4600. They advised me of the work Centennial had done and replacing this belt was one of them. This made me wonder if the reason it fell off was due to them not properly installing it. Findlay suggested I take it to Centennial and that if I'd purchased it from them they would help me out of this situation. I called Centennial 4x the following business day and got no return phone calls. The next morning I started calls again and spoke to a sales \"manager\" named Jason who showed zero empathy, handed me off to the service dept and I had to make an appt w them. When I checked in at 9am on Saturday they were under the impression I was going to pay for them to confirm the diagnosis. The service \"manager\" did not hear the knocking until I went to the car with him and pointed it out; at that time he agreed it was there. This confirmed it was overlooked when they initially \"inspected\" it. If I could vaguely hear it the day I drove it home then I can see how it was overlooked. With that being said, this car should have been taken back into their possession and money should have been refunded in full. That is the ethical and correct thing to do as a company. \nNeedless to say that did not happen. Instead they offered me $900 toward a trade in. It gets worse, the sales boy (Ody, who had been there 2 months) offered me $2500 as a trade and they'd pay off my loan. Ody had no clue how an actual loan works which is really sad since he's attempting to sell them to customers. He kept telling me they were going to take care of my loan balance... when I met with finance (after 4 hours of waiting) I notice they loan was refinanced into this new loan and the trade in was listed as $900. Basically these morons thought I was as dumb as them and would just look at my monthly payment and run. I asked to speak with a manager and here come Jason again. This idiot had already passed me off to Ody the moment service walked me into the sales room. How this loser managed to get \"manager\" added to his title speaks volumes as to how this place is run, very ignorantly. He told me he would increase it to $1400 and I can either take it or leave and take my car elsewhere. He was rude, unprofessional, and condescending (which is the all-time low coming from a car salesman, dressed as if he has an adult job). \nAt any rate, I walked and I went to a Honda dealership, bought a brand new 2016 civic which I know won't die at 80k miles and from a respected dealership that has integrity. \nFYI for any of you that have had similar experiences with this awful business, please call Toyota directly to place your complaint; the number is 800-331-4331 \nOne last thing to keep in mind, test it if you must, call the dealership, leave a message for someone, anyone and see if they call you back. Believe me you will want to work with a company that returns calls in case something does come up after you purchase. Check online reviews, you'll see they are known for not returning calls. \nAnother thing to notice is the 30+ sales reps walking the parking lot, but they have only 4-5 finance employees which is why it takes 8 hours to even get out of this place. \nYou will also notice each review will show a reply from the owner, this is an auto reply generated in order to appear as if they are handling the negative complaints, trust me, they are not.",

    "text": "I found a used 4runner online located at Centennial Toyota back at the end of November, I rushed down there as it was exactly what i was looking for and the price was right. The salesman was Jay Bakarji, he was great. Got in and out in about 2 hours for a price I was happy with. Love the 4runner. Shortly thereafter a check engine light popped up, Jay told me to bring it in and they would take care of it. I purchased it 'as is' as it was an older 4runner with crazy low miles. So I expected to pay for part of the fix as part of their 50/50 1,000 mile 2 month warranty. I didn't make an appointment and it was a busy Saturday, it didn't even go back to service as a service writer read the code and said the gas cap hadn't been tightened. So they cleared the code and I was on my way. \n  About a week later the check engine light popped up again and since Centennial is so far from my house i took it to Findlay as I have a 3rd party warranty and I felt it couldn't hurt to have another dealership take an unbiased glance at it. Findlay came back with a grocery list of fixes totaling about $3200. 3rd party warranty wouldn't cover it as they claimed pre-existing which it would have been so i was a little frustrated. Felt like maybe my deal wasn't so good, but hey if Centennial will pay for half, i still have a great car that i love. \n  So fast forward I take it back to Centennial, service writer Eddie Frank. He was very accommodating letting me know if there are problems he would see if Sales Department would cover full cost, which they didn't have to. So after discussing items that Findlay claimed were faulty Eddie explained they would look at my car but the items described sounded like typical, normal wear for a car of my age. He showed me toyota literature detailing the conditions described by Findlay as normal wear and in good working order. After the mechanic assessed my vehicle, they found faulty parts causing the check engine light but also found items that Findlay said to be faulty actually in good working, normal wear, condition. Eddie said that Centennial will cover full cost to replace parts causing check engine light. awesome! \n\n   I had a similar experience with Findlay a couple years back with my wife's Camery; they printed a book of fixes totaling about 12k and told us just to get rid of it. We fixed a few hot items for about 1200$ at local shop and the car is still running great. All in all, i don't think i will ever go to Findlay again. Service is a huge money maker and i felt like they were trying to get me to fix perfectly fine parts.",

Then after he ran the credit he didn't want to do anything except let us know I wasn't able to get anything without more money down then what I actually wanted to put down.

So far we have purchased two vehicles from them in the past when they were actually doing very good job and now they've turned to the worst employees of that company.

It was supposedly a big garage sale of cars where cars would be sold as low as $77.00. I'm not gullible I knew that it would probably be only one car or some sort of catch but we go anyways. \n\nWe get there and ask about the \"$77.00\" dollar car and they said it's a car they are raffling off. We were about to leave when they asked if I would be interested in trading in my car. I told them I would consider it if they can lower my interest rate from the current 6.25%. \n\nThey upgraded me to a Toyota for 2% interest rate for the life of the loan. I had time to back out of the deal because their power went out for like an hour. I was hoping that was not some sort of sign. We decided to go for it but it was a long process...I think we were there for like eight grueling hours. \n\nOne word of advice is to look over the paperwork carefully and double check what they tell you. The car we bought came with a 100,000 mile warranty so why was there a 50.00 hidden service fee in the paperwork? They did correct the paperwork when we pointed it out. \n\nIf they tell you that buying a certain car will lower your insurance rate by so much ...check on it. We did the salesperson said our discount with our insurance would go down $13.00 a month but when we called it was something like $2.00 a month. They are car salesmen first so I understood why their facts may be skewed so I know it's always best to check all the facts first. It's hard sometimes to watch out for everything especially when going there on a whim with no prior research. \n\nOverall I thought their service was good just as long as they do all that was promised.",

They are trying to pawn me off, wont return my calls and wont answer my phone calls unless I call blocked.  Dont take your car to get service here!!!",

I go there to get the car , there is a new sales person and he is like I don't know who you spoke with but we can do 15,500 K. \nThen they say oh we don't know who she talk to but she made a mistake. they say we don't have this policy over the phone as if I was hallucinating. very disrespectful. they tell you a price just to get you there then say another thing there. Imagine if they are this dishonest just to ask about the price how dishonest they are about their cars. \n\nHe also tells me I own the car for 13,900 I can give that for that price plus tax and fee 15,500 as if they are doing a community service they don't want to make any money themselves. They also lie to your face to get you there and when you question them they give some stupid answer as if they are talking to a little kid.\n\nDon't go there very dishonest dealership. I have called many other honest dealerships that just say NO to your price over the phone and at least they respect you enough not to get you there and say something else.",

Bought my scion 5 years ago and drove off in tears after dealing with the nastiest car loan guy ever. Well, this year I thought, I should give them another chance, MAYBE, just maybe, it was just one bad experience. Well, they sold us a car with lots of hidden damage which was already found by their own inspection a week before we bought it. Here we are waiting for them to \"clean\" the car because it is pretty much \"ready\" for us when the service side informs us that the car has about $4,000.00 worth of repairs needed on it and shouldn't have been sold to us in the first place. \nI'm being incredibly sweet with this review and not even mentioning the fact that once you buy the car it is nearly impossible to get a hold of any of those \"nice\" dealers and your voice messages get sucked into a giant black hole that resides in their voice message system. On my mind I have a volcano of bad words about ready to erupt at all the BS we have had to deal with buying from them. \n\nTip: DO NOT buy a car from them, but if you have to, make sure EVERYTHING is pristine and ready to hit the road BEFORE you sign ANYTHING, because once you sign those papers, you will be Alice in Wonderland lost in the abyss of lies and miscommunication.\n\nAlright, now I'm off to fight the dragon to get my money back.",

It wasn't until I got to meet with the financial manager Silvino Reyes, the nastiest person to deal with ever. He was so pushy in trying to make me buy add on's and when I kept telling him no, he will just keep going and going to the point where he scared me and I didn't want to buy their car anymore. I ended up buying, but left his office shaking. What a horrible person to deal with. In my own words: he was Stupid. I waited for Toyota to contact me and rate my buying a car experience but they didn't. Now the Sales man Raul promised he was going to get mats for my car, it came with no mats by the way. Three months passed by and I still don't get any mats, and when I ask him, he only says be patient we haven't received a car like yours to take out the mats. Really? He's going to take the mats out of another car? He is telling me Toyota hasn't received another Toyota 4 runner? Who does he think I am..? One more thing, they said Wells Fargo was doing my loan, later I found out, it was another bank in Cali doing my loan.\nIt was a traumatic experience.

Obviously a manufacturers defect. \n\nTime got away from us and when we brought the car in for routine maintenance we failed to have the seats addressed. \nRecently I brought the car in to have the seats looked at. Oscar said the car was out of warranty but I could contact Toyota directly. This is what we did but Toyota required an estimate from Oscar regarding the cost to repair the seats. \n\nOnce we got the estimate my husband submitted it but Oscar had the audacity to tell Toyota that the problem with the seats was from \"wear and tear\" thus negating our claim. He wasted everyone's time and made a false statement to Toyota!  I've never seen \"wear and tear\" where the leather doesn't even cover the seat cushion properly on both seats. \n\nWaiting to hear from Toyota but I'm sure our claim will be denied. Thanks Oscar.",

    "text": "I just recently purchased a 2012 Toyota Prius in the beginning of this month at this dealership, and probably the last time i buy from here. The salesman, tall young guy, had no knowledge of the vehicle, and when i questioned details about it or the carfax report, he would start yelling and overall have an unprofessional attitude. The finance manager was salesman were unable to answer my question as to why the vehicle was not \"certified\". This salesman also advised me since the car was not ready, that in two days I would receive a courtesy shuttle to come pick it up. After 4 days it was finally ready, and he drove the vehicle to my residence, which i don't know if that's legal or not since i signed the closing docs already. After two weeks of driving the vehicle, which runs great, however the radios would intermittently shut off, just the audio,  for no reason. So i take it to service department, and the adviser tells me there is nothing he can do about it since the issue cannot be duplicated. Jerry, the Service Director, assisted me and attempted to have the radio replaced by contacting sales manager, however they rejected it and advised me to wait until after 30 days so i can pay a $50 deductible with the service protection I purchased. \n\nI'm not sure how Findlay Toyota or Autonation function, but i would avoid dealing with Centennial at all costs. Why did i buy from there? They had the color, year, and mileage I was looking for in a Prius, and probably got a good deal on it, however they lack in service and respect. If you do buy a vehicle from them, make sure it works or buy a warranty, because they can care less what happens after that.",

    "text": "WOW! Where do I begin. First we went to Honda in Henderson twice, lol. (That was such a joke both times. (STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!). The 1st time I laughed and walked away, drove across the street to the Chrysler, Jeep dealer, and ended up buying a Chrysler convertible, from Miguel A. Sotolongo. We loved him from the get go, but I have to tell you, from being retired from the same business and YEARS! of practice, I, as a customer, felt the stress of the dealership. We kept the car for 2 yrs, and it was still so beautiful, however, with being an older Senior couple, we found that it was just too low for me to get in and out of due to health reasons. So, after going to Henderson Honda the (2nd  time 2 yrs later, LOL) and them wanting 14,078, down, on a 23,000 and  only wanting to give us $7047.00, which our black book was $11,300, with it being in excellent condition, and Also, in 2 years we only put 3427 miles on the car, I found myself saying \" I have to find Miguel!!!\"  So I did. Miguel A. Sotolongo, was working at Centennial Toyota., We made and appt. and I did my homework, and he gave me what I wanted for my car,(BLACK BOOK) and he worked a deal, that was so unbelievable. He's like magic, he makes it happen. I got a 2017 Toyota Rav4 LE with a lot of bells and whistles, that I wanted, and he didn't try to sell me a car that was too much. This Crossover is sure plenty for me. And so pretty, too!  All I can say, is go see Miguel Sotolongo at Centennial Toyota. We are so pleased!!!! There dealership is so relaxed and so clean. It was a no BS sale, and a great experience....\"As long as our old loan gets paid, it's all good\" Quoting my husband....LOL!\n\nNow I'd Like to speak to you about Joe in Finance. He is so organized, quick, and he knew that we didn't drive a lot, but, he showed us the warranty, up to 75,000 miles, I believe 50,000 miles, and 5,000 miles, knowing I wouldn't purchase, because #1 We don't drive too much, and #2 he came from Chapman Chrysler & Jeep as well. and I saw 2 other salesman that moved to this particular dealership, from Chapman.There's a reason for that!! All I can say from a lot of experience, stay away from the Henderson Auto Mall. Anyway, what I liked about Joe, was he broke down the warranty to about the only 3 things we  really needed. Being in the finance business, for years before retirement, he did it the old school way, which completely impressed me. So, we did get the Security system (but it was already included in the price coming from Miguel A. Sotolongo). So,all we really paid extra for was $26.77, added to our payment, for our Gap, and 50,000 miles of free service, includes everything. \n\nWe are probably the happiest customers they've ever had, and we can't thank them enough.\n\nSincerely,\nKim and Dave Hockensmith",

The first problem I encountered was with Sal in the financial department. I was told, on a Monday, that the check I wrote for the car would not be cashed until that Friday at the earliest so I can be sure I had the money in my account. On Wednesday, I received a text from JJ that the check went to the bank. I called Manny to see if he would help, since he was so eager to help before I signed on the line, and he didn't return my message. Luckily Wells Fargo was able to reverse any penalty charges. I actually had to bring centennial Toyota a cashiers check to remedy their mistake. When I confronted JJ with the situation he became defensive and apathetic. Before driving off the lot JJ promised me car mats (since there weren't any in the vehicle and that seems pretty standard). In the midst of the check fiasco JJ reassured me that I would get my car mats shortly. Since then JJ reports that he no longer works at centennial Toyota and I still have no car mats.

    "text": "I just bought a used from these guys. \n\nLet me just get to the point \n\nI was lied to. I was told 9.9% APR, it was written down and confirmed.  \n\nThen the car salesman's manager is there to push the sale. I had questions and he was quite annoying on how he answered them. He didn't know anything about they are selling.  He kept pushing me into buying. That's all they care about. A check. Commission. Making money. There's no care in the way they do business. \n\nAfter I sign the papers, because I did want this car. It was a good price.  I go to pick it up the next day. It's really out of the way from where I live by the way. I notice 2 HUGE cracks in the windshield that weren't there the day prior. They weren't going to fix it and said it had been sealed and it wouldn't crack anymore. I threw a fit and told him the sale isn't finalized until I drive off the lot and that I'd cancel the whole transaction. They then agreed to fix it, but you could see they were annoyed with it.  What about me?!   I was really fucking annoyed. \n\nA week later I had to drive ALL the way back. Sit there for 4 hours. The guy in the service department I dealt with obviously has Aspergers. Yippee. That was fun at 7am to deal with, especially after I worked until 3am. \n\nAlso, the car salesman that helped me is now terminated, and the things I was promised never happened. No owners manual (said he would get me one) and no extra key. \n\nThey fix my window and didn't wash the car or clean the inside out. Okay you can't clean the glass because it has to set for 24 hours. But clean up the mess your mechanics left. \n\nThen after all is said and done, the APR isn't 9.9% it's well over 20%. I'm fuming. How did I NOT SEE THIS?!?!  Because they're god damn swindlers. They tricked me. Told me one thing and then another thing is given. Seems to be a big issue with this dealership. I should have read the Yelp reviews first. \n\nI've contacted my lawyer and he will be investigating these jerks. I'm sure the employee who was fired can be found, subpoenaed and the truth will be stated.  What a bunch of bullshit!!!!  To continually deal with these assholes and I don't even want to deal with this, but they will get what they deserve and from the courts. \n\nThis dealership is true slime!  \n\nIf you go here. Make sure you take someone with you so they don't corner you and lie to you. And make sure you read everything over completely before signing\n\nOH AND THEY NEVER RETURN YOUR CALLS. I got one call back and he was super unhelpful. Two many people involved and no communication.",

    "text": "Our experience with Jay the salesman was fine, hence the one star here. I was going to do 2 stars but I'm still so upset that I cannot do it.\n\nWe got 2 cars with him and really felt like he tried his best to get us good deals.  The Major problem we encountered was with the Finance Manager Silvinio Reyes.  He was so antagonistic, rude, aggressive, insulting and angry towards my husband simply because he may not have wanted to get an extended warranty. I understand sales tactics and sales numbers are important, but obviously this person does not care at all for customers or customer service.  We went in today and spoke with the Finance Manager and we appreciated his time as he did listen to our complaints.\n\nUnfortunately, AFTER we purchased our cars, I saw on yelp that other people have complained about similar tactics, and another person in particular pointed out Silvinio Reyes.  This leads us to believe (and it was verified by some employees there) that this has happened multiple times and he has still for some reason been allowed to speak to customers like this. Most likely because he is able to hit \"numbers\" selling the extended warranty..?. We even signed for one after he gave us a discount, but still the way he treated us was completely Unacceptable. There is absolutely no reason to insult, bully, and antagonize paying customers (or non paying customers for that manner), and there is no excuse. Working long hours, being tired, whatever it may be: I don't care. I don't care if he had a bad day. And I don't care if he's the best \"salesman\" (aka bully and aggressor) to get large sales numbers or is efficient at paperwork or diligent in his duties. Don't take your anger out on my husband and his 76 YEAR OLD mother.  Don't insult my husband and make my mother in law feel like she has to defend him. Don't treat people like dirt because they may have not wanted an OPTIONAL warranty.   And on top of that, we ended up getting it because he offered some \"employee discounted price\" to make it more affordable, and even after that he STILL talked meanly and antagonistically. I told him that I felt his behavior was getting really negative towards us, and he got even more antagonistic and aggressive. Whether we got the warranty or not, we should never have been talked to or treated that way.\n\nLong story short, at this point, there's not much Centennial Toyota, or even Toyota corporate can do. I have already written a letter to the GM at the dealership, and I will be writing another letter to Toyota Corporate to let them know that this is just plain unacceptable. Unfortunately. I wish I could say we complained and the manager said he would give us a free car detail or fill up our gas (which he did say) and that made us feel better.  Or I wish I can say we used this to get leverage on a better warranty, or other perks, etc (which we didn't care to ask for). I wish I was a mean person to say that him being fired would make me feel better.  But I don't care if he's fired or not, I don't care if he's still there or not, I don't care if he got a warning or not. We don't care about that and we don't want ANYTHING from them except that he never be allowed to talk to anyone like that, ever again.  We suggest some sort of training for customer service, or mandatory recordings, to ensure this doesn't happen, as well as actual consequences for unacceptable behavior to make someone like him think before he speaks/acts. Or, maybe to just go back in time and never have met a person like him!\n\nThe truth is, this is something that can never be \"taken back\" or fixed because it NEVER should have happened, and it NEVER should've happened more than one time, which obviously it has.  No one should ever speak to anyone in the manner that he spoke to us, Especially in a sales/customer service venue. I've never had even a friend or enemy or someone I know speak so rudely and sarcastically and blatantly hateful, much less a Stranger who is trying to \"Sell\" us something.  The managers and the other people at Centennial Toyota may apologize that this happened, and we appreciate that and all, but I don't know what would make us feel better at this point because it just SHOULD NEVER have happened, to Anyone. Ever. Period. Him having acted this way more than one time to a paying customer is Completely unacceptable and appalling.\n\nWe do like our new cars. We did appreciate the time given to us by our salesman, some of the other salesmen, and the finance manager to hear us out. How sad that the last person we had to meet soured everything for us to the point of crying, getting high blood pressure, and feeling so upset and insulted, when we should've been excited to enjoy our brand new Toyotas.\n\nI decided that I would not suggest anyone to purchase or lease a car here, but I if anyone does end up at Centennial, to make sure to wait, even for hours, for Anna or anyone else in the finance dept other than Silvinio Reyes.",

I called the dealership in California and he said they would replace it for $550.00 to replace it.  So please this place takes advantage of seniors and women.  Caution Caution Caution!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Car shopping is never fun, but I am giving Centennial Toyota 5 stars because they made the process as easy as possible. We visited several dealerships over Memorial Day weekend, but this is the one where we bought our Yaris AND had the best service.\n\nWe did a lot of research online and we emailed Centennial Toyota about what we were interested in. Surprisingly, this gave us special pricing on the car and saved us quite a bit of money. Also, it kept people from swarming us because we already had the name of a sales person that we wanted to talk to. \n\nOur sales person and finance guy were both very nice. They were animated but not too pushy. They were straight forward with us and because we told them exactly what we wanted they didn't try to add a million different options to what we had planned. They gave us water when we first got in and while they were doing the initial finance stages we were able to get a free lunch. \n\nThe salesperson didn't talk down to me (as they often seem to with women) and encouraged me to take the first test drive. He let us drive the car on surface streets and the freeway and then let us switch drivers so my boyfriend could take a spin as well.\n\nThe atmosphere was very pleasant, despite it being a busy day. From walking on the lot to driving away in a new car it only took us about 2 hours.\n\nI definitely recommend this place and I also recommend emailing them in order to get a better deal!",

    "text": "Don't waste your time if you have a trade-in...\n\nMy husband was looking for a new truck and we started at a dealership up the road and then Centennial Toyota. The sales guy was nice, not pushy and really understood what my husband was looking for in a truck. We were ready to start negotiating the deal.  I mentioned to \"K...\" that we don't like to play  negotiation games and we don't want to go back and forth 4 times with payments.  I knew we had good credit. We have a trade in-Ford Explorer 2005, excellent condition. Still making payments and knew the blue book value, but  \"K\"(our sales guy) didn't know how educated we were. \nOn the Tundra there are no incentives, no rebates, that is ok because we knew the quality of the truck we were considering was worth it. They came back offering $2500.00 for a truck that is in Kelly blue book as trade-in value for $6200.00, really!\nI was disgusted!!!!\nAfter we asked for them to respect us knowing that we wanted our payments between 4-500, they still low balled us. WHY?\nI was disgusted that they thought it wasn't a big deal to add $5000 into a payment because they want to low ball the trade.  Our truck is selling on craigs list for 8-10,000. So as I quickly exited the building I knew this was not the dealership I wanted to work with, Sorry K... Your negotiation manager needs a new job!\nThe Nissan dealer up the road agreed to give us $6200 for the trade. Before we decide on the Nissan were gonna check out another Toyota dealer, the Tacoma  is worth it. I felt disgusted that they would take advantage of someone like that, NO DEAL!\n\nPlease be careful with trade-in values, here you will be low balled so buyer be aware!",

    "text": "In all my years of buying new cars, I have dealt with many types of car sale people, most of whom were decent people that just tried to make a living.  However, there were some that just disgusted  you so much that you wanted to leave the dealership and never wanting to come back. You might even go out of the way to persuade your friends and relatives to not ever do business with them. The internet sale people I dealt with at Centennial Toyota  fits the latter category. These sale people will offer you deals or said that they will offer you hundreds below  the lowest offer you have received. Once you showed up at the dealership, they and their sale manager will renege (back out) of their promise and tried to negotiate thousands dollars more than what was agreed on. Not only it wasted my time, their sleazy tactic just pissed me off. Want to hear something funny?  This is what their so called \"sale manager\" told me  after backing out of the agreed price: \"Normally we would sell this car a couple thousands over MSRP price, but today you can just pay me the MSRP price plus tax.\" Wow, I guess I should be grateful for his generosity (sarcasm!!!!). I guess he thinks Toyota falls into the same category as Tesla or Ferrari or those rare exotic cars. SMH.",

    "text": "I came to this dealership after researching several vehicles and coming to the conclusion that a 2015 Toyota Corolla was the best fit for me and my budget. I went on their website and saw their inventory and subsequently scheduled a time to test drive the vehicle. On my initial visit, I was greeted by sales associate Slade Talbot. He was very kind, non-pushy, patient, and informative during the sales process. I was in a tough situation since the vehicle I wanted to trade in had extremely high mileage for a 2013 (around 95,000 miles), so I knew I was going to be around $7,000 upside down with negative equity. Slade was very honest and forthcoming about what my options were. He and a finance manager were kind and respectful of the offers I made for a monthly payment. I decided to take time to think about it and went home to discuss my options with my fiance. Slade was very patient and did his best to get me the best deal with the final offer I made with the dealership. We eventually reached a negotiation which I thought was fair and sealed the deal! My first visit (test drive, vehicle appraisal, financing offers) only took about an hour and a half. When I came back for my second visit to seal the deal, the final finance paperwork and signatures only took about an hour. It was very fast and simple for a car purchase! They offered me a great deal and I'm loving my new Corolla! I've had the vehicle for nine days now. \n\nAs for their service, I've been working with Tom, who is very kind and helpful. I had service get my windows tinted as it was a part of the original deal. The service department did great on the windows, but when I got home I noticed a scratch on my trunk that was not there prior to service. I called Tom and he told me to he would look at the vehicle for me this coming Tuesday. I understand accidents happen. So I'm hoping the scratch is taken care of. If so, I'll definitely keep this five star review up! If not, I'll be changing it.\n\nOverall, however, I've had some very positive experiences with this dealership.\n\nUPDATE: Tom definitely lived up to his word and took care of the scratch. The area looks brand-new. Service department is very kind and efficient. Great job!",

    "text": "Not trustworthy at all.  I was supposed to meet one of their sales people at a scheduled time, and I ended up waiting for them for almost half an hour at the front door, I should have just left, but I was trying to be nice.\n\nFirst off, they wanted to know how much I was willing to pay per month, which wasn't a big deal, but every-time I gave him a number,  he disappeared for 20 minutes and came back with a ridiculous quote.  Then, he told me that if I wasn't going to put down $7,000 then I wouldn't be able to buy a new car.  Which was fine, because I currently own a car from 2012, and I was just browsing, and really didn't need a new car.\n\nBut before I left, they tried to get me to buy an older corolla, which don't get me wrong, Corolla's are the best cars on the road, but I'm not going to trade in my 2012 VW for an older model car.  While I wasn't impressed with this idea, I did let him try to sell me on it, and when he showed me the car, I looked up the stock number on my phone, and discovered it was $1,000 more than what was on the website.  Of course he lied and said it was a better deal because he wasn't charging me the $1,295 \"reconditioning fee\".\n\nWhen I left, I was so glad I hadn't made the mistake of falling for their lies and schemes.  \n\nOverall, save your time and money and go to Autonation Toyota on Sahara, they have been the most helpful by far, and offered me a fantastic deal on a 2014 corolla for way less than Centennial with a much better down payment, and better terms.",

While I was asking him about the cost etc. of the oil change Tom Blemings kept interrupting with his cocky attitude with his own questions. What happened to customer service? So instead of being helped, I had to listen to their conversation for 5minutes. Lack of customer service & lack of courtesy.\n\nOn top of that they lied to me numerous times! I asked if my car was almost ready at 3:30p. He said it would ready soon. 2 minutes before that I saw my car being pulled into the service station. I don't like to make assumptions and have them the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe it was just the same model as my car. Well it was my car because I confirmed the license plate. LIARS! I asked him why my car was just now going into the service garage. He looked flustered and said it would be ready soon. Very incompetent people here. They don't know how to manage their people, they don't have people skills, and they don't have manners. If you have a Lexus, don't go here. That was my mistake. I see a huge difference in how luxury car employees are way more professional.\n\nLook I can understand that people get busy. I wouldn't have minded if they told be it would take longer than an hour because I could've went home and had my husband drop me off. But instead, they kept lying to me about when my car would be ready. \n\nI am not going here again. The customer service is horrible. The people I dealt with have absolutely no people skills, they are rude, and sleezy. \n\nTo reiterate, my appointment for an oil change was at 2:30p, I was out of there at 4:20p. Ridiculous.",

One on the sales side and one on the repair side.\n\nI have been in the market for a new Toyota truck...I went here since I saw the car I wanted and was ready to make a purchase...the salesmen was alright and after finally getting down to the terms that I was happy with the \"closer\" which was one of the sales manager came out and basically killed the deal with his rudeness and terrible \"closing\" skills.  I walked out and decided that a car wasn't worth that effort.\n\nMy wife owns a 4Runner and a received a warranty recall notice in the mail for a dashboard defect.  I take the car in to have the additional recall done and had to inquire about the specific dashboard one.  Well we get the call to tell us the car is ready...I asked about the dashboard and was told we \"slashed\" the dashboard (don't even get me started on the accusations this dealership states with no just cause) ...interesting since I googled the complaints that started the recall and was in the exact same place and length as mine.  I guess all Toyota 4Runner owners \"slash\" there dashboards.  The warranty recall even states that it can split for any reason.  Apparently this dealership didn't read that portion.  Furthermore since we complained they took pictures and said that a \"regional\" manager would look at it...we waited 5 days for a call back and nothing (not shocked by the way).  We called to inquire at the progress and was told...no we haven't heard anything but you should find another dealership for your business.  Actually the last part was the best advice we were given.  And your right our business and future car buying/repair will be with another dealership along with all my friends and family I will tell about my experience.  \n\nOh and just to let you guys know who have repair done there...the time quoted is never right, and they have at least 5 guys standing and watching parked cars instead of servicing.  \n\nTomorrow Toyota will also be hearing my complaint.",

    "text": "If you are into being scammed and treated like dirt, buy your car here!!  \nMy wife and I ordered a 2014 Highlander LE Plus to be built exactly to our liking at another downtown dealership.  We live in the Centennial Hills area so we thought we would just take a look to compare.  Of course, dealerships are good at getting you to go in and sit down to have a \"chat\".  We told them our situation and they couldn't compete with our pre-ordered vehicle because they don't have any LE Plus models on their lot.  The manager then said that they want us to walk out with a Limited edition.  We told them that it is outside of our budge as their available inventory was well above $40k.  They told us to name them a price and after some hesitation, we did.  It was a low one, and we told them that we know its a low one simply because we didnt want to exceed our budget.  We were ok not getting the Limited as we were excited about our LE Plus that was soon arriving.  They went back to the GM who approved the deal.  We have told them our plans to trade in my wife's old car, including our owing balance.  They also came back and said, no problem... they will do it.  So we were excited.  We wanted to go back the next day with money and all but our sales guy said he was off so we went back Friday (2 days after the deal was made).  We go Friday with a cashiers check and cash to pay for the vehicle planning maybe an hour tops for paperwork.  We sit there for over two hours, waiting for the documents to come so we can sign and drive off.  Then sales guy comes back saying that the same GM, who approved and lured us into spending over our budget, is now over the phone saying that he can't sell it to us at that price.  Got Joe, the floor manager involved.  He tried to do the typical car salesman buttering up but that doesnt fly with me.  So all he said to me was \"we dont even have to sell you this car at all!\".  They said they won't take our trade-in either and that we have to pay more for the vehicle.  Long story short, because we needed a bigger car, we paid their proposed higher price anyway.  But during the entire process, even the finance manager, who chimed in annoyingly, was very condescending.  They treated us like we just robbed them and took advantage of them... like we were scums... when really they were pulling something shady last minute.  Since then, the only person kind enough and cared enough was Debbie, the customer relations manager, who has been wonderful... however, there are limitations to what she could assist with.  None of the higher management is concerned enough or have the courtesy to call me back to discuss the situation.  \nLastly, our title has been sent to the wrong place TWICE... and still at this point (over two momths after the purchase) we dont know if that issue has been corrected by the dealership yet.  It was a piece of paper our bank provided to give to the dealership, with all very clearly stated instructions and address to send the title.  Somehow it is done incorrectly twice, and counting. \n\nSo yes, if you want this kind of first-class service and this kind of hassle-free experience, buy your cars to your hearts content here!",

He then stated that there was \"something wrong with people today\" and shoved the key to me. He walked away with an attitude and when I told him he was rude, he responded saying that I was rude. I do not comprehend how someone that lacks customer service skills can function in a workplace where customer service is essential.

Normally, I avoid sales guys like the plague when I'm \"window shopping\" cars, but I couldn't find the damn Camry Hybrids, so I caved and asked for help.  \n\nRaul was very nice and I told him up front I'm not buying today.....he was cool with that and walked me around the main lot and rear lot to show me the various models of Camry.  Many of the cars were in the back lot, with only a few in the front.  Why do they do this?  It's very inconvenient to walk to the back.....I guess it forces you to talk to a salesperson......damn slimy car dealers.  Why do I always feel like I'm about to get screwed when I visit a car dealer?  I consider myself pretty good at negotiating a deal and always carry my HP 12c financial calculator when dealing with them.....but I still feel like I get screwed over.\n\nAnyway, I test drove a few of the models and was very impressed with the Camry Hybrid....it has a lot more power/speed than I was expecting.  I guess I was expecting golf cart performance.....but it was much more powerful than that.  I left without making a purchase, but the experience was pretty good.  I was never pressured to buy.  Thanks Raul for great service.....if I decide to buy a car here, I will give the sale to him.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",

    "text": "This place is an unbelievable NIGHTMARE. There's a reason car dealerships and salesmen have such a HORRIBLE reputation for thievery, manipulation and dishonesty. Try buying a car from this place and you'll discover WHY. Centennial Toyota is the perfect textbook study of scummy, crooked car dealerships. How these people conduct themselves in their business borders on CRIMINAL. Oh, they'll pretend they care, but it's ALL a LIE designed to draw you in. They don't give a SHIT about YOU: their only objective is FORCING you to buy the car THEY want; and, they ABUSE you as a customer throughout the ENTIRE process. I know, because what I experienced here firsthand was one of the most HORRIBLE customer experiences I have ever had with any business anywhere.\n\nWalked onto their lot at 5:30pm and was greeted immediately by a salesman named Irwin (Irwin later confided he only had one month experience selling cars). Told him I was looking for a used car that would seat more than 5 people and that $15,000 was my absolute TOP limit to spend. We spent a few minutes talking specifics and found only ONE car, a 2010 Toyota Highlander, that came even close to my requirements. The Highlander had a $18,999 price painted in BIG letters on the windshield. I test drove this car with Irwin and it drove well, but I told him it was TOO MUCH MONEY for my budget. I told him numerous times I couldn't AFFORD it. He informed me that this car was priced slightly higher because it was a \"Certified, pre-owned,\" Toyota. I found this strange, because there was a HUGE, DEEP key scratch across the ENTIRE driver's side of the car. There was also a bent and crumpled rear wheel well liner, a broken CD player flashing an ERROR signal and other conspicuous signs of damage and wear on the car.  A \"certified, pre-owned\" car with SO MANY obvious problems? Really?\n\nInstead of being HONEST and admitting there were currently no used cars in inventory that matched my criteria, Irwin dishonestly lead me to believe they would bring the price of the car down into my $15,000 range. That was a flat-out LIE that subjected me to the next three hours of the most stressful, brutal sales beatdown I have ever experienced anywhere. He just wasn't going to let me get away. They threw EVERYTHING they had at me. They pushed me to commit to buying the car before they would give me a final price. They repeatedly asked me how much I would be willing to pay in order to buy, then IGNORED my answers. They INSISTED I needed to buy THAT night before I could leave the dealership. WTF? They brought in extra sales people and mangers to the table to tag team and pile on me. They used GUILT (\"Buy the car, because you're wasting our time!\"). They used FEAR (that car will be sold by tomorrow). For their opening offer, they showed me a piece of paper with a $23,799 price crossed out and $18,999 written in below. Apparently, even though $18,999 was painted on the WINDSHIELD, they told me that the car was really $23,799 and they were giving me an exceptional DEAL at $18,999.  Wow! Such a \"deal.\" DIRTBAGS. They refused to let me HOLD or KEEP anything in writing they presented to me. DIRTBAGS.\n\nAfter about two hours of this I started getting angry, but they still wouldn't let me leave. I even TOLD them I was getting angry...numerous times. They DIDNT care, they just kept working to wear me down. I finally got completely disgusted and walked out. Irwin ran after me in the parking lot, where I had a heated exchange with him. He ended up throwing a business card at me and yelling, \"F___ YOU! I don't want your business anyway!\" I turned around and stormed back in and went to the service desk to talk to the sales manger. I told him what had just happened and he looked at me like I had three heads. In an smirky, smart-ass, condescending tone of voice he said, \"So WHAT? What do you want me to do? Fire this salesman? Would that make you happy? Why would I do that? You're the only person here who has a problem.\" They talk and act like they're selling timeshares. They don't CARE. They operate on a business model where they make the customer WRONG and humiliate you if you resist their manipulation. DIRTBAGS.\n\nThat night, I went online to autotrader and found that EXACT, SAME Highlander I had driven at Centennial Toyota. Centennial had it priced online for $16,999. Holy POS business practices, Batman!  DIRTBAGS! The final insult came a few days later. Obviously forgetting who I was or what had happened, Irwin called me and left a VM on my cellphone, addressing me by the wrong first name and told me he now had a nice used 2010 Toyota Highlander on the lot for only $19,000 and that I should \"drop by and check it out.\" It was the SAME car. I kid you NOT.\n\nHey, Centennial Toyota, I'm going to repost this review on NUMEROUS social media review sites. I'm also going to send it UPLINE to CORPORATE at Toyota. Feel the LUV, you WORTHLESS MFs! You DESERVE whatever you get! BUYER BEWARE.",

This dealership misdiagnosed my vehicle problem and put my family at risk.  \n\nWhile on a road trip from Phoenix, Arizona to Salem Oregon, the air conditioning in my 2007 Tundra goes warm.  I diverted to Las Vegas and went to the service drive at this dealership at 6:30am the following morning.  The technicians waited almost two hours for the A/C to fail, finally it does and they assume the amplifier switch needs to be replaced under the dash.  This is a $700 job and of course, the part needs to be ordered in.  Another day in the hotel.  The next day, its installed and I'm on the road again.  Before I am even out of Las Vegas, the A/C fails again in the exact manner as previously.  I immediately call the dealer, very upset as I am having to drive across the hottest desert, at the hottest day, on July 31st. I am very upset and informed the dealer I was.  I had my wife and two babies in the backseat.  A 1-mth, and a 17-mth old. \n\nAs we are driving through the Mojave desert at 117 degrees with two young children in the backseat, the service advisor, Tom Bleming, calls me back and apologies and says his Service Manager Gerry is behind me 100% and to get to a Toyota dealer as soon as I arrive in Salem.  I did so and sent Tom an email informing him that I dropped the vehicle off at Capitol Toyota.  In the first few minutes at Capitol Toyota, they diagnosed the problem by checking the A/C system with their charging station (duh!) and saw that its pressure was 250lbs when normal is 150lbs.  They immediately suspected the expansion valve was plugged.  They removed it and saw black slime on it which came from the compressor.  Compressor replaced, $3000 job and very satisfied A/C is running perfectly.  Why couldn't Centennial Toyota do the same?  You would think a Las Vegas dealership knows something about air conditioning?  \n\nDuring this whole process, I am emailing Tom Bleming at Centennial Toyota.  I sent him several emails and he never responded once.  I finally called and left a message with all details and he never called me back.  \n\nFinally, I write this review.  I am angry for the incompetent work, I am angry for ignoring me.  I purchased this truck brand new from Centennial and this is how they treat their customers.  I will never go back and will continue with leaving negative reviews on both Google and Yelp so that others may be aware of the shotty work they can receive at this dealership.  I'm also considering filing a complaint with the BBB.",

I notice something was wrong with car when I test drove it (exhaust issues)... I didn't want to purchase it until it was fixed, however I was told I should by the salesmen (who RUSHED ME). Because I am gullible, I went ahead and purchased it. Wednesday was the day they SUPPOSEDLY fixed it. And in the state of Nevada, once you purchase a vehicle, it is yours. Of course the next day I drove it and it still sounded shitty. And not only that, but the brakes were squeaking. I just purchased this vehicle. I complained and COMPLAINED about it and wanted my car that I traded in back and of course that didn't happen. They insisted to fix it or I had the choice to trade it in for another one that would cost me over 850.00/monthly. If I was gonna pay that much I'd go somewhere else. And because this place and the sales people are ridiculous, I waited for my green slip, 3 weeks later, and I took my business elsewhere. FINDLAY TOYOTA helped resolve this problem and I happily purchased a 2015 Toyota 4Runner. I wish I went to FINDLAY TOYOTA first because my experience at Centennial was a complete NIGHTMARE!!! Purchasing a car is a big deal. People at Centennial Toyota are so RUDE and don't care about YOUR NEEDS. They have very bad customer service!!! If you're looking for a new car...

First of all I was happy with the purchase experience and felt as though the online pricing/sales was above board and honest.  I was more concerned when I was \"handed over\" to financing and told to watch for hidden fees.  Seriously?  I was actually called back and offered a better deal within 48 hours if I could put down an additional amount on the car, also.  So much for having a good sales experience.  \nOn to the service department (which is why I'm actually writing this review tonight).  I was told when I purchased the car that I didn't need an oil change for another 10k miles (due to it being a hybrid) but the mechanics set the sensors to go off at 4,000 like a regular gas model.  I went into the shop and instead of the 39.00 oil change that I was quoted over the phone I was charged 69.00.  Afterward I was called to pick up the vehicle and told that a nail was in my tire and it would have to be replaced for another 189.00.  Who has heard of a Camry tire running 189.00?  I told them I couldn't do it right then and promised to come back next week.  Wow.  I won't be going back to that dealership EVER again.",

He never suggests anything that isn't needed and is always fun to deal with. The only thing that I have had go wrong there was they once accidentally changed the transmission fluid in my Highlander, but they didn't charge me for it so it was actually a great favor to me. Service is always great and they don't have your car for too long. I don't know what the previous reviewer had happen there, but I can't say I have ever had an experience like that. I have referred all of my friends and family to them and no one has ever had an issue. I won't take my car anywhere else.",

    "text": "Unscrupulous business practices and questionable ethics at Centennial Toyota********\n\nOn or around, April 11th, 2016, I expressed interest in purchasing a 2015 CPO Prius stock # 00460545. The business manager contacted me on the phone and requested a deposit of $100 via credit card to secure the vehicle. I provided my credit card # and was repeatedly assured that the vehicle would be set aside while I travel from Los Angeles (LA) to Las Vegas (LV)  to purchase it the next day.\n\nI then proceeded to rent a one way rental from Burbank, got a cashier's check and started to drive to LV.  As I was halfway towards LV, I decided to call and inform the Sales Person Ron Shirley that I would be arriving at 6 PM.  Much to utter disappointment, Ron casually mentioned that the \"vehicle has been sold.\"  When inquiring what was the point to place a deposit if the car was to be sold in an unscrupulous manner, he seemingly mocked and commented that \"stuff happens.\"\n\nI have since contacted the General Manager, Anthony Woods explaining the matter in detail.  I was assured the deposit and expenses incurred (rental, gas) would be reimbursed the next day.  Almost a week later, I have yet to have the charges refunded.  I have since disputed the charge with my credit card.  I also plan to pursue a civil claim should the matter not be resolved favorably at the earliest. \n\nI would stay away from this dealership as they are unprofessional, dishonest and unethical.  Rather than customer service, the entire apparatus is geared towards fleecing a customer.  You can read my detailed report on YP, Google, BBB, Dealer Rater.",

    "text": "This review is for both Centennial Toyota and salesperson, Elton Rosas. First let me establish my credentials. I am a retired detective lieutenant from a major eastern city. I am skeptical, unbelieving  anytime the human element and money are involved. We (my wife and myself ) came to know of Centennial Toyota through TrueCar.com. Not all Toyota dealers participate. The basis of TrueCar  is transparency and the elimination of the game playing auto dealers are known to do with pricing.Utilizing Kelly Blue Book for invoice price and the MSRP on all available accessories for the RAV4 and in conjunction with TrueCar.com we had in print the total price of the car with the specific accessories we wanted and the standard delivery charges in writing and agreed upon before we ever left our house to drive from St. George, Utah to Las Vegas. I am not prone to give compliments but the following is well deserved.\nOur salesman, Elton Rosas was fantastic! Right from the start he dealt with my flurry of questions and obvious disbelief in a professional but friendly manner. I was looking for the hidden costs, the up-charging on accessories, the last minute add ons and those things that dealers state they have no control over, it never happened. Everything he stated, everything we wanted, everything agreed to, everything in writing  occurred exactly in that manner. We drove to Centennial to complete the paper work , down payment, the ordering of the car in person. In addition to assuring us we would receive the rebate from Toyota, other dealers would not, everything went exactly as Elton Rosas stated. The different extended warranty plans were presented to us but we were never high pressured. Elton kept us informed as the car we wanted was located and the options were being installed in \"port\" and when the dealer would take delivery and install the other options we selected. In addition to keeping us informed I had numerous questions on the process which Elton explained in detail. When coming to pick up our new RAV4  Elton was there to greet us and stood by patiently while I examined every inch of the exterior and put the car up on the lift ( my request ) \nfor me to examine the under carriage without hesitation. Then we finalized the paperwork and payment. He went on to explain to my wife all the features and nuances of her Ruby Red RAV4. The amount of time from the first phone call to when we drove away from the  dealership Elton gave us is beyond calculation. The service, the patience and professionalism he exemplified I have never seen in a salesperson anywhere! Least you think we overpaid for the car, we did not. TrueCar shows you the low, high and middle amount being paid for the car within the last 30 days. We paid between the low and middle price, $2300.00 less than \nthe dealer in St. George Utah AND received window tinting and vin related window etching... Right from the start I was waiting for the deception, game playing, fight to start and the \"other shoe to drop\", it never happened. Did I mention the car was spotless AND a full tank of gas. Elton as a representative of Centennial Toyota was perfect and professional, words I do not use often!  Was Centennial and Elton Rosas this way because of how I am or is this their way of doing business. My educated observation and experienced evaluation indicates to me  our problem free new car purchase is the standard operating policy of Centennial Toyota and their staff. Great dealership with fantastic personnel !",

I know it was because I walked my car before I left it there and walked it again when I picked it up.  Now I have two spots that I have to fix and pay out of my own pocket.  I have even talked to other mechanics and painters who both say the same thing...a chemical was dropped on my hood. BEWARE!!!",

    "text": "I brought my 14 Tundra here for its first oil change a few days ago.  Overall a pleasant experience, especially considering I did not make an appointment.  I was greeted by a service writer within a few seconds. He explained what service was included with my Toyota Care program (synthetic oil change and tire rotation).  The waiting area at this dealership is very nice and includes a vending area with FREE cookies, computers with internet access and a smaller room with ESPN on a TV.   There is ample seating, wifi and plenty of magazines to read.   The parts department has a nice selection of accessories and I passed some of the time browsing in there.\n\nThe service to my truck took about 90 minutes, which was fine considering I did not make an appointment. \n\nI did not buy the truck at Centennial so I cannot speak to their sales practices but I will be returning for service again.\n\nUpdate:  Had another oil change on 11/22/2014 and the experience was better than the first time.  They had the truck done within about 30 minutes.  My service advisor - Doug Falla - was great to work with.  Updated to 5 stars for the service department only.\n\nUpdate: Had another oil change and some recalls done on May 22, 2015. The experience this time was not quite as smooth.   I mentioned to the service writer, Ed, that the truck is making a \"knocking\" sound on cold starts.  A few hours later I got a call that the truck was done and was advised they were unable to duplicate the knocking sound.   I expressed some frustration that of course they did not hear the sound as the engine was warm.   They agreed to keep the vehicle overnight so they could try to duplicate the sound in the morning.   I did not receive a call the next morning to let me know the vehicle was done so around noon I called.  Ed was on vacation and I got shuffled around a bit before someone was able to look up the status of my truck.  They were not able to duplicate the knocking sound (which I understand - it is an intermittent issue).  I had my wife drop me off a few minutes later and, once again, got passed around a bit because no one seemed to know where my keys were.  Kind of strange that there was not one person assigned to be Ed's backup but finally after about 15 minutes the cashier was able to secure my keys and send me on my way.  \n\nI'm not lowering my star rating, yet.  Still happy with the overall speed of service at Centennial.",

They basically told me they sell their \"certified used vehicles\" with used batteries and don't know how old! As long as the battery works they'll stuff it in your car and say its certified. My battery died a year and a couple months from my purchase and I look on the battery that says 84month warranty. I call and make sure I would be covered, make an appointment, and drive all the way down there. Upon my arrival, Chuck says the battery is not only NOT covered, but it would cost $160 to replace. Essentially, they sold me a car with a half dead battery and then when it died, they said it wasn't their problem. How are you going to sell a car with a used battery on its last leg and then not replace it when it dies? Your warranties and service are crap! I cannot wait to trade in this POS Corolla and rid myself of the entire Toyota brand. They do not care about customer service whatsoever. I even asked the director if he thinks its ethical to sell cars with batteries like that not knowing they are almost dead and then NOT replacing the crap battery a couple of months later. He paused and started giving me the runaround again about the warranties, coverage, and regulations. All I can say is AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS! They will tell you everything you want to hear when buying the car and say all these cool things you'll be covered for and when it comes down to it, its all lies. You're covered, but only for a certain amount of time, miles, and they throw so many different stipulations at you, you don't even know exactly what's covered and what isn't after the whole ordeal. Did I mention everything in their service center is 30-40% overpriced?! How they ever get good customer service scores is beyond me.",

All and all I was rushed to hang drywall to hurry and close and that was a month ago.... So I got ripped off for that job as well another 320 down the toilet. \n\nI would highly recommend going to your bank and abound these people at all cost!",

    "text": "Our home purchase in the summer of 2013 posed some unique challenges given the extended close time, 90 days, and general volatility of interest rates throughout the summer. Victorian Finance was not helpful in helping us navigate these challenges and added substantial anxiety to the home buying process.\n\nWe had an offer accepted to purchase a home in early June with closing to occur in late August. We were working with a realtor from Coldwell Banker. Coldwell Banker refers clients with financing needs to Victorian Finance. We decided to go through Victorian Finance even though we liked our mortgage broker when we purchased our first home because we thought it would be beneficial to our agent who we really liked.\n\nGiven the extended close we were not able to lock in a rate right away. Since this is standard practice this was understandable. Even though we couldn't lock in Victorian wanted to get started on the documentation required for the mortgage which we provided and confirmed with Victorian they had received it.\n\nThe problems began 6 weeks later when we had to prove our financial viability to the seller. Our contact at Victorian was on vacation and his associates were unable to locate our documentation so we had to re-send everything. It's summer people are on vacation it happens.\n\nWhat I felt was egregious was that instead of taking responsibility for the oversight Victorian communicated to the sellers that we had not bothered to provide the documentation needed to obtain a mortgage. This was especially problematic for us because this gave the sellers the chance to back out of the sale and this was a possibility because they were having some challenges in closing the sale on the house they were buying. This would have been a devastating outcome for our family because we had sold our home with a traditional 60 day close and had already moved and were temporarily living with a relative.\n\nLuckily things worked out and we were able to proceed with the process of buying the house. The next problem occurred when we tried to lock in a lower rate when it became available. We immediately locked in our mortgage when the opportunity arose 60 days before our close. We had the opportunity to re-lock once if interest rates moved in our favor. A few weeks before the close rates moved down and we decided to execute the option to re-lock.\n\nWhen we contacted our representative to facilitate this we received notification he was on vacation again. Shouldn't have been problem anyone could help us with this. Unfortunately our representative's colleague who attempted to assist us misunderstood the parameters of our mortgage and told us we could not re-lock. By the time our representative was back from vacation and things were sorted out we had missed the opportunity to lock at the lowest rate possible. This is going to cost us $30 a month for 30 years or over $10,000 in total.\n\nThe final issue was relatively minor. As I mentioned we provided documentation first thing when we started the process of buying a mortgage. Well it turns out all of the documentation was out of date by the time we had to close so we had to re-send everything. Given Victorian was unable to located the documents when they were initially required this was a frustrating turn of events for us.\n\nMy rating is 2 stars because we did get a mortgage in the end and were able to move into our new house. Given the challenges of dealing with Victorian though I would not use them in the future and would not recommend them.",

Staff was pleasant to interact with, just the way they were trained to do by corporate or the branch manager.\n\nPlenty of parking spaces whenever I am here.  So I would say this is a good branch for customers that mainly utilizes ATM to conduct their WF transactions, with the occasional in-branch visit.\n\nGetting out of the parking lot to head North on Jones can be a pain, if you are there during peak traffic hours.  In which case try to use the center turning lane, and Frogger your way over as needed. Just be careful of north-bound vehicles that want to turn left onto Spring Mountain Rd.  Don't want no real life Game Over head on collision or hassles with insurance companies and Five-Os.\n\n4 stars.\n\nBe safe!  Peace in the South China Sea.",

What I wanted was $100 to go toward my credit card and to exchange the other $100 bill for $20s. Sounds simple enough, right? Apparently not! The teller (wish I remembered her name) took the first $100 bill, processed the payment and printed out the receipt. Then, another employee comes up to her and asks if she saw a cashier's check \"lying around somewhere.\" She looks around her area and tells him no. Then she takes my other $100 bill, puts it in her drawer and asks \"is there anything else I can help you with?\"\nMe: \"Ummm, I'm waiting for my $20 bills for the other $100 bill I gave you....\"\nHer: \"Didn't you only give me a $100?\"\nMe: \"No, I gave you two $100 bills.\"\nHer: \"Did you really?\"\n\nSo she calls her manager over and tells her what happened. Then she said \"I got distracted because ______ interrupted me and asked me a question.\" The manager tells her to count her drawer. Just great. So I have to stand there waiting for another 10 minutes because she didn't do her job. BS I tell you! When she was done, she laughed and said \"Oh, you were right.\" Duh!! Seriously, WTF?!?! If you can't multi-task and/or pay attention to what you customers are giving you, maybe you SHOULD NOT be a teller?!?!\n\nI did complain to Wells Fargo over the phone about the incident, but who knows if that even did anything. Ugh....never again!",

But at least he released all my funds like there policy states... so a month later i figure I would give it another try.. )everyone has their bad days).. so again go up to a teller.. really nice girl... I hand hey pay check with the stub connected to it.  As usual.. she does her little thing and hands me a receipt... ok kool.. keep in mind I use my debit to only pay bills and keep a little for emergencies because of fraudulent activities .. so I pay all my bills.. come to find out the girl didn't release all my funds.. she never told me that!!.. so now my bank account is at $-104 and I don't kno why.. im on the phone with my bank for an hour trynna figure it out and they figured it out for me.. so I proceed to call the this scam ass bank.. I proceed to ask the lady their policy on shared branching.. she said as long as the stub is attached they release the funds.. so I told her my stub was attached and your teller made a mistake that caused me to go into the negative.. she proceeded to get REALLY DAMN RUDE with me.. told me to take it up with my bank and tild me its a \"privlage\" to bank with them and hung up the phone in my face...  so that's my experience with this HORRIBLE bank and I will never return again.. thank you for costing me money to bank with you.. toodles..",

The deadline was coming up in a few days and I had no free time. Instead of trying to figure it out myself, I called the DMV vixen to just get it done and over with. Getting a hold of her was easy. Just shot her a text. Within a few hours of getting a hold of her she had already come to my work office and picked up the necessary documents after telling me exactly what I'd need. The next morning she sends me a message saying that the trailer was registered and that she'd be dropping the new license plates off in a few hours. Few hours later she comes to my office again and drops off the plates. Quick and efficient. If you need to get something done at the DMV and don't have the time to go, try giving her a call. Her rates were affordable compared to some of the other companies I checked and her customer service was great.",

    "text": "This issue is with Liberty Mutual Homeowners insurance and local claims agents based in AZ but with a regional office in Westminster, CA. Once we get a resolution we are pulling our business due to a lack of trust and horrible customer service.\n\nOn the front of our home we have a decorative column. It is not structural or weight bearing but in October we noticed that it had shifted several inches and was leaning with some damage to the top and bottom stucco base.\n\nThe slope of the roof tends to delver rain runoff onto the base so the assumption was that settling or water damage - or both - had contributed to the shifting of the column. Concerned that there could be further shifting - and because my wife and I are not familiar with what could have caused the damage or if there was a possibility of the column shifting further and \"falling off\" - I called our insurance company.\n\nI placed a call to Liberty Mutual to introduce this concern and they initiated the claims process. Mark, the local Scottsdale Liberty Mutual claims agent, visited the property.\n\nHis first thought was water damage - something not covered by insurance. However, he decided to have a structural engineer take a look at the internal structure of the base which would require the stripping of the stucco and removal of the column in order to see what was going on inside. The Liberty Mutual agent and the structural engineer both assured me that this was investigative and that the stucco would be replaced.\n\nAt no time during this process did I commit to making repairs. We put in the claim in order to see what the issue was and what would be covered or not covered.  Our claims agent stated that he needed to get inside the structure to look inside and confirm his thoughts.\n\nIn January we received the Liberty Mutual report stating that the damage was indeed caused by water and would not be covered, just like Mark thought before his teams took the column down and ripped out the stucco at the top and bottom of the support where the column once was.\n\nI followed up with Mark about the report and to find out when they would be out to repair the stucco, as the internal framework of the already damaged base had been subjected to additional rain storms, now with no protection. The front of the house has 3 ugly pieces of wood standing where the column once was and there is no stucco where there once was stucco.\n\nMark became defensive and said that \"I have no intention of fixing anything\" - note his use of I as if it is his money. He continued on saying that he did us a favor by having the teams take the column down and get into the structure.\n\nI countered by repeating what he and the structural engineer said about repairing the stucco that they tore out when Liberty Mutual insisted on looking inside of the structure. He said that he never said any such thing and that it is up to us to repair it and move on.\nI ended the call at that point. A few days later I called into the Liberty Mutual main line and asked that my complaint about this treatment be noted on the account, and that I needed to speak with Mark's boss. The lady I spoke with took the information down and tried to reach Jim Smith, who apparently runs the local/regional claims office. She made a note for him to call me back. \n\nSeveral business days later I called again. Same conversation. I provided a new phone number as well. Still no call from Jim.\n\nA week later I called again. Same conversation. I stated my unhappiness and that I would be pulling my business once this matter was settled. Still no call from Jim.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is that I called Liberty Mutual because there was a potential issue. We at no time stated that we planned on making imminent repairs but they felt that filing the claim would allow us to learn what the problem was, if it was covered, and then sort out the best way to proceed.\n\nThe claims agent could have just said water damage - not covered - and we would have been able to proceed with repairs on our timeline, based on when we'd have the funds and availability to do so.\n\nHowever, they insisted on digging into the house for a diagnosis that they already had in mind and now refuse to fix the mess that they made. If they did this for investigative reasons then they should repair the damage once they saw what they needed to, or they should have been crystal clear with us that once the stucco was stripped and the column removed that we'd be on our own from there.\n\nWhen you take your car in for a diagnosis the mechanic doesn't rip out all the parts, tell you the problem, and then force you to pay to fix it. No - they investigate and tell you what the problem is before taking all the pieces out.",

In eight years with them for up to nine properties, I have only had one claim, and they handled very quickly, no hesitation.

But if you have several properties, you have to dig up and look up the policy number in all the paperwork and see what property it is for.  I have contacted them several times over the years, and they agree it can be improved, but they haven't done it yet.  Maybe this review will push them to do it, finally.

    "text": "Make no mistake about it... Healthy Paws is not a charitable organization. When it comes down to it they are a business first and foremost and if your pet doesn't meet their starting specifications then you are out of luck.\n\nIn January 2014 I rescued a Savannah Cat from a terminally ill lady who could no longer care for her. My cat had been through two homes at this point and was not taken care of. I took her in and had a few thousand dollars worth of work done to her out of my own pocket (mainly, teeth all removed and antibiotics). I then applied for insurance through Healthy Paws to which I was accepted ( as they will always accept you as you pay up front and then they will accept/deny your claim later). I took her in for infection and breathing and Healthy Paws denied my claim outright. They even denied the claim for ruptured anal glands. \n\nThey said that everything was a \"pre-existing condition\" and thus denied it all.\n\nFor granted, I am not a doctor/vet but I feel like everything could and would have been called pre-existing just for the sake of denying my claim. After all, she was neglected by the prior owners and even when in my care she needed medical care. For me to bring her to the vet for care, then months later apply for insurance, and then go back in probably did seem like me trying to scam them.\n\nI understand their denial in part but I still find it unfortunate that one cannot rescue an animal who has been neglected and get a helping hand to try to make the animal at peace. It is not like I had the animal for 8yrs and suddenly problems set in and then I went \"oh shit, I better get someone to help me pay for this.\" I rescued a sick cat and needed help. I even emailed them before applying and told them my situation. Still to them all was pre-existing.\n\nI paid almost $4k caring for my cat but in the end she need more care than I could afford. This story ends as sad as it can - she needed extensive care and even that care was not guaranteed to completely fix her (she may have suffered brain damage). So in the end I did as much as I could an opted for euthanasia.\n\nIf you read the reviews of pet insurance you will notice a trend - people bought insurance long ago and probably never had any issues. After paying $25-$50 a month for nothing for 8 years sure, the insurance would pitch in. It is much like an extended warranty - the sellers hope that you never cash in. The same is true of Healthy Paws - if you buy from them and (in their opinion) think it is too soon or if they can link it to something earlier... then they will deny you.\n\nThey aren't charitable in that way.\n\nBeware.",

I got a ticket in January 2014, and went to Craig Kenny and associates lawyers and got it reduced to a parking ticket, no points on my license & paid the $300. All finished right? No it wasn't because I tried to continually pay my car insurance for 4-5 months afterwords and couldn't figure out why my payments were not going through. I called the office but they didn't answer it just rang off the hook. Time went by and I tried to pay a double payment the following month the website wouldn't work and I couldn't understand why I went through 4-5 months of this hell & by the 5th month the website said I had no account with them however the direct debit (LIFE INSURANCE) was still taking out money from my account, so that statement surprised me. I knew I was late because the website wasn't working and I had placed unanswered calls each month. Basically THEY dropped me with no notification!!!!! No phone call, no letter, no E-mail. I got the ticket on January 9th. They dropped me January 10th with no notification! That should be illegal. They had no problem keeping my life insurance though and taking that money each month though. That's the thanks I get after YEARS of being a loyal  customer. I thought Heather Spencer, the head agent played nice but when I got a E-mail of lies saying they informed me when I was dropped, I knew she wasn't in the business of honesty.",

This location is small with tile flooring. Vanessa (I think was her name) was really nice, but this was extremely intrusive. She asked questions in a loud perky voice, and as a result everyone in line could hear your personal business. Her job is to make sure you know that there is an atm outside and online banking, and tries to shorten the line by sending customers to use these resources. And she tries to make it personal by asking personal questions. Bank of America this is extremely inappropriate. The lady in front of me (after I regretfully and awkwardly answered about 10 questions out loud, going into my method for paying rent and the fact that I'm moving and where and why etc) finally told her she thought this was weird and didn't feel comfortable explaining her business for everyone to hear. Why didn't I think of that? Ugh. \n\nThe 5 of us in line proceeded to discuss how odd and uncomfortable the whole experience with that was. No offense to Vanessa, but it was extremely offensive to us. I still feel uncomfortable.",

The staff there was much more personable and the wait was nonexistant.

It is refreshing to work with someone in real estate who isn't just trying to make a sale but truly wants you to be happy with your decision. Sean listened to our criteria and concerns to find the perfect home that fit our wants and price range. He never pushed us to consider a place we didn't like or tell us that we won't find something better (I've heard this happens way too often!!!). With our difficult schedules, he was flexible and able to work with us when WE were available. To top it off, he worked to find the true value of our home that it actually appraised at, so we didn't have to over pay and put more money down up front. Basically, Sean is pretty awesome and probably the best choice you could make if you're looking to buy or rent in Las Vegas.",

There were two other employees on the side having a side conversation. When the first customer left, I went up to the window and the lady told me her computer just went down. All I wanted to was ask a question, but she told me to get back in line and wait until the next teller was done. Well, after waiting for another 5 minutes, the next teller (a man) was done, and I said I wanted to get a document notarized. His response, \"I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask the two over there.\" The \"two\" (a lady and a man) he meant were the other two employees who were having a side conversation. Well, I went up to the lady and she told me Philip was the only one certified to notarized and apparently NOW he is with a customer. Of course, after spending 20 minutes there I'm not going to wait. I rather drive to another B of A branch tomorrow to get speedier and better service.",

    "text": "Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to. I recently opened an account online with Bank of America. After nearly completing the application, my computer timed out. I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again, so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received. But due to their crappy system restrictions, I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not. \n\nThe following day, I received an email stating that my account application had been approved, and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return. I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving), and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX, so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later. \n\nGoing through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail!), I found the signature card letter, debit card, debit card instructions, debit card pin number, and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed. \n\nI called customer service to find out why the account had been closed, and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done. I asked why the account was being closed, and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity. I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was, considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet, and there wasn't any money in the account. She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away. It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online, and somehow that was suspicious??? \n\nI asked to speak with a manager, and have currently been holding for 50 minutes. Unless you have buckets of time to waste with this financial disaster, DO NOT open an account with Bank of America.",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying that as a family, we have been with State Farm for over 30 years, in California and then Hawaii and have had nothing but exceptional service up until now. \n\nWe recently moved from Hawaii to Arizona and contacted Mr. Swanson's office as it was closest to our new home. When we moved to Hawaii from California it was a smooth transition of simply updating our information with a local agent and we had absolutely no issues for the 10 years we were there. I assumed it would be an easy transition when we moved to Arizona as well. Boy was I wrong. After contacting his office we went in to meet with one of Mr. Swanson's agents, Tyler. He was helpful and kind and made it seem like the transition was all taken care of. We wanted the exact same coverage we had in Hawaii, the only change was to simply add my husband's newly acquired classic vehicle on to our existing policy. He gave us temporary cards and sent us on our way. \n\nAfter that day we have spent the last six months trying to correctly update our policy. My husband travels for work so he has very little time home with his family and literally  every weekend since we moved here 6 months ago we have had some kind of State Farm issue we need to spend hours on the phone trying to correct. From the get go there was an issue with the underwriters and our policy was completely changed from what we discussed in the office with Tyler. We thought, okay, not his fault mistakes happen and attempted to correct the issue of my husband's classic car being reclassified as a regular vehicle and tripling in price along with several other policy discrepancies. No one at Mr. Swanson's office called us to let us know the policy was changed, we only learned of the change when we received incorrect insurance cards and policy information in the mail. \n\nWe then contacted Tyler (he never contacted us) and he assured us it was taken care of. We receive another letter in the mail a week later letting us know our policy was being cancelled due to lack of automatic withdrawal and a lack of information about my husband's classic car. At that point we learned that he never updated my husband's classic car information (we drove there 2 different times for him to take pictures and document the car) and did not put our payment information through even though we signed up for automatic withdrawal and both of us went in to his office to sign the auto withdrawal paperwork the first week we were here. We called his office again and did not receive a response so we spent hours on the phone with State Farm's assistance line trying to pinpoint all the issues. They let us know nothing had been updated or corrected from that first initial meeting.\n\nSo, with our policy in jeopardy of being cancelled we received a call from a woman at Mr. Swanson's office (still not Mr. Swanson himself) letting us know Tyler was no longer working there and she assured us they were correcting the issues to get us up to date. They had no idea what Tyler did and seemed to have no information from the initial meeting we had. We made an automatic payment (more than we were supposed to pay) just to insure our policy was in good standing until they corrected all the issues. We again wrongly assumed that it was all taken care of. We received another letter in the mail that seemed to show our correct policy and updated information from the underwriters but received a call from the woman at Mr. Swanson's office telling us they had never received that policy and in their records we still had the incorrect one and they had no idea what that correct policy was. I had to go to their office and physically give them a copy of this policy so they could bring our policy and account up to date. \n\nAfter several other issues and miscommunications, we received a call from Mr. Swanson today now letting us know that the woman who took the copy of our correct policy was no longer with the company and they had no information about it. Between the run around, lack of communication and the countless hours we have spent trying to remedy this with customer service, I am very disheartened. \n\nIn 30 years we have never once had any issues and now during a hectic time in our life, a big move to a new place with three small children and my husband traveling for work 85% of the time we have lost all peace of mind with our insurance company. Isn't that what the point of insurance is, peace of mind? I'm very disappointed and don't wish this mess on any one else.",

My wife and I had been speaking about life insurance lately and we felt very overwhelmed by all the information out there.

All in all, Mr. Swanson made sure we understood our entire policy and made sure we left his office feeling more secure with our insurance policy.

I went in to get proof of my new address and not only did a personal banker help me but she helped me to open a savings account which now allows me to have free cashiers checks, etc.  So yesterday I go into Bank of America with my boyfriend where he has an account (HAD an account, that place sucks and we are dumping them) and he requests a cashiers check for a large amount and it was going to cost him a $7 fee.  They run his debit card from the 2nd institution where he has his money and BofA says it's too much and it won't process.  So he calls the other bank, we wait for about ten minutes and when he gets the larger amount approved to be run through his debit card, the teller at the window unapologetically tells us that because she already ran his card once she can't do it again.  Why didn't she tell us the precaution before she ran the card in the first place?  Or how about telling us after it was rejected once that she cannot run it another time and so don't waste 10 minutes of our time calling the other bank to get it approved?  So we run to my bank, Wells Fargo, which I have been a faithful member since age 16, and the process was so turnkey and friendly.  No charges, just smiles and a 'have a happy weekend!' on our way out the door.  Wells Fargo definitely rocks :)",

The first house I made an offer on, they sent out an appraiser that was illiterate using an appraisal which looked like it came from another property then he appraised it $20K below what its actual value was.  So there went my appraisal fee.  The the next house, I was approved for the loan and was ready to close and had movers scheduled to move my furniture and then because I accepted an advanced position making more money with another organization, they tried to delay the closing for another 2 weeks to a month.  Resulted in me  losing the house and expedited appraisal plus the additional expense.  Needless to say I fired them and went with another lender.  Very unreliable.  Had me doing a lot of the foot work to obtain financial documents that they were being paid to gather themselves.  If you have any other options for a lender go with that one and save yourself a lot of expense and aggravation.  I feel sorry for anyone that has the misfortune of dealing with this lender.",

    "text": "I do not recommend.  This was the preferred mortgage company for a builder that I was using and there was a financial incentive to use them.\n\nI had a unique situation where I am a 50% owner of a rental property in another state.   I also run a home-based business.  I spoke with Chantel and she told me that it was not an issue, and let me know what I qualified for.  I provided all of the required financials and all was good until 30 days out.\n\nThen the problems started.  I had to keep providing financial information for the business in various formats.  Suzi, the loan underwriter, sent a rude e-mail waiting to know why my YTD numbers had October blank.  It was only 10 days into October and I don't do the books until the end of the month.  That was not sufficient.  But sending the same document minus the last month (through the last completed month) was OK.   Same numbers, same totals.  Bank statement after bank statement was sent.  Profit statement after profit statement (the business makes a fair amount of money).  They were requesting documents from financial providers that didn't exist.  Statements without a logo on them were insufficient (seriously, had the bank name, but not a logo).  Finally that was taken care of.\n\nThen the next bombshell just a couple of weeks out.  Chantel was \"not aware\" that the they changed their rules on rental properties.  I'm a 50% owner, I claim 50% of the income and expenses on my taxes which Uncle Sam is fine with.  CNN, not so much.  They now require that I need to be capable to cover 100% of the expenses.  That would be fine if they would let me claim 100% of the income, but for that they can only use what is on my taxes!  So I'm responsible for 100% of the costs, but can only use 50% of the income toward that.  Basically I was showing to be at a huge loss each month and it affected my qualification.  We're now days out from closing.     \n\nI had to get the builder involved to smack some sense into these guys, otherwise I wasn't going to have the house.   7 Month process and the issues arise in the final days.\n\nThey were able to find a different loan that for my situation, but it wasn't the type that I wanted to be in and it costs me more per month.  \n\nOnce the loan closed (fortunately on time) the fun continued.  CNN Mortgage \"forgot\" to have the final appraisal done and it had to be done after we moved in.  They also \"missed\" documents that we had to sign AFTER CLOSING.  \n\nThese guys are a joke.  Avoid them at all costs.  The builder has dropped them after many similar complaints.  I have a profitable business, plenty of money in savings and they treat me like a criminal.  \n\nAnd the ironic part, they sold the loan immediately to another company.  And that document says by law they (CNN Mortgage) are required to notify me 10 days prior to the transfer.  I got the notice from them 5 days after.  Ugh!",

    "text": "I would never use this company again. This was the preferred mortgage company of my home builder and had a financial incentive to use them. I had the displeasure of working with Angie Smith, who I can only assume is a stay at home mother who does this on the side from home. I have nothing against working from home while raising kids, but when dealing with a mortgage, the few times I talked to her on the phone she had kids screaming in the background. After a certain point in the transaction, all phone conversations ceased and the communication went strictly through email. Angie often would not pick up a phone call, but then email me right back. \n\nDuring this long process, I had to work in Texas, and kept getting requests for more and more items to be provided, signed, etc... I wasn't able to take care of this while in Texas and asked Angie if we could meet in the 48 hours I would be back one week because I would be gone again for another long period of time. She agreed to finally meet, but then when that day came, nothing. I don't know that Angie even has an office to go to or if we were going to meet at a coffee shop.\n\nThe reason for this 1 star review was because I never at any point in this experience felt like I mattered as a customer to her and her communication is absolutely horrible. In the end I just wanted to meet at an office, that has a printer and internet, and I would have been able to provide her with everything she needed right then and there, instead of these long email threads going on and on and on, and being drawn on and on because she is shuttling her children to and from different places.\n\nAngie, if this is something you want to do as a career, make the people you work for feel like they matter. Your inconsistent communication, and reluctance to pick up a phone call is very off putting and borderline offensive. I had to stop and think about what the heck I was getting myself into, signing all these papers from someone who won't even pick up my calls, but is about to originate a loan on my house for me. Big or small, mansion or motor home, everyone you talk to should be shown some type of priority. I highly suggest you pick up the phone next time one of your clients call you, because I'll be honest, I ONLY went with you because of the incentive, a mistake I will NEVER make again. Thank you for teaching me that lesson!",

I had a lot of insurance situations to untangle and he and his rep Caralyn Lindsey took right fine care of me.\nI recently moved here from out of state and needed to change car insurance agents.  After getting jerked around on the phone by 2 or 3 other agencies,  a co-worker recommended that that I try All Kinds of Insurance (I like their name!).   Boy, am I glad I did.  Caralyn answered all my concerns to my complete satisfaction and wound up taking care of ALL my insurance needs.  Plus, I was coming down to the wire, and had less than some hours to get insured and she pulled it off!  She turned what was overwhelming into smooth resolution.  Now I have someone I can recommend without hesitation.  Jeremy's smartest demonstration of his business acumen was in hiring Caralyn!  He doesn't just know his business, he knows business.",

I was able to just tell Jeremy what I needed and he just took care of finding me the best prices possible and took care of doing all the plan transfers.  He found me better coverage at a lower rate than I found, and pointed out where we were deficient in coverage (and fixed it) without increasing our costs.

Time to hit Yelp to see who/what is available out there to help provide information and assistance.  I came across Jeremy & All Kinds of Insurance, saw there were excellent reviews, took a deep breath and dialed them up pretty early on a Monday morning.\n\nI was quickly connected to Jeremy who was able to fit us in for an evening appointment to review all of our needs and help us make an educated decision. The process working with him has been as \"painless\" as it could be and he was very informative, helpful, and quick to put us at ease about our options for the coming year.\n\nWe reviewed multiple plans, and discussed the pros/cons of all of them, including looking at plans that aren't currently advertised on either the exchange nor off exchange. We finally were able to whittle down our choices and commit to a plan for 2016. Never did we feel rushed, judged, or pushed towards any one particular choice by Jeremy. We left feeling very comfortable with our choice both in our health insurance coverage as well as our choice utilizing Jeremy and All Kinds of Insurance.\n\nI would recommend them without hesitation.",

Jeremy Shugarman knows just about everything about health insurance and answered all of our questions.  We setup my father's insurance to be active on Dec 1st.  When we received the activation letter stating that my father's insurance is to start on Jan 1st instead of Dec 1st, I called  Jeremy Shugarman and let a message since this was during Thanksgiving holiday and was expecting a call on Monday but he called right back, found the problem and fixed it right away even though he was not working that day due to the holiday.\n\nGreat guy, very friendly and responsible.

She was too overwhelmed with the baby's medical issues to even think about trying to figure out what her options were. I knew she was running out of time, so I called Jeremy to ask for help. He answered all of my questions, made recommendations and sent a quote with several options for us to choose from. Then he emailed the application that we needed to complete. Every time I called with a question, he either answered the phone himself, or returned the call within a few minutes. It was SO nice to not be dealing with someone on a phone bank.\nOnce we got the forms completed and returned to him, he got them processed immediately so that my great-niece's coverage started on the first of the next month. That was less than 2 weeks from when I first contacted Jeremy.\nSo even though I live out of the area and can't use Jeremy's services, I would strongly encourage anyone who does live in Las Vegas to take advantage of his knowledge and terrific service.",

    "text": "Needless to say I was Bold face LIED to, INSULTED and HUMILIATED...\n\nThey told me after my experience at Larry Jay Mitsubishi \"We don't care about your credit past, we can get anybody financed they only work with about 10 banks, we work with over 40 and we'll do everything we can to get you financed.\" \n \nWRONG AGAIN!!!!!\n\nHere's my scenerio and experience with them;\nWent in, I know my credit stinks because of a number of things (divorce, economy etc.), I'm trying to rebuild it...\n\nI work contract, income is about 3.75 times the Median Income for the zip code I live in.\n\n(Wednesday 12/10/2014)\nSat with the salesman, they ran my application through the banks they use, the salesman came back with an offer from Sterling Bank $3000 down, I accepted but needed to do $1500 that week and $1500 the following. There was nobody from the bank available (7pm) to authorize that and probably wouldn't be before they closed so the salesman was good enough to have me take off and he'd work on it the next day...\n\n(Thursday 12/11/2014)\nGot a call from the dealership the next day, she said I was approved, after clarifying a few times and she said \"I spoke to Rick in finance, Sterling has approved the loan, $1500 tomorrow, $1500 next Friday, so you can come in, pay the $1500, they'll finalize the paperwork but you can't take the car home until the full $3,000 down is paid next week\"... I was totally fine with that ... then she said \"the only thing they're working on is whether they'll possibly be able to let you take the car home tomorrow or if you have to wait until next week, but it is a 100% done deal, the car is yours, congratulations\"!!  Needless to say I was pretty stoked, was offered to work overtime the next day but I was like \"nope ... going to part of the down and secure my new car tomorrow\"... Had I only Known...\n\n(Friday 12/12/2014)\nI was so excited I could barely contain myself ... so my wife and I ran to the dealership, figuring we were going to be in and out in short order, after all, all we had to do is sign the loan paperwork and give them the $1,500 towards the down right?!?\nWell, Gus (the sales manager) had us come into his office, started out by saying \"you know what your credit situation is...\", (my thought of what would come next was 'we're not going to be able to let you take the car home until next week when the full down payment is satisfied') ... NOPE!!!! his next words were \"we couldn't get you financed because they don't think you have good job stability being at the company you're with for only 3 months and living in 4 states in the last 5 years (didn't seem to matter that they know I'm a contractor and have been doing the same work for over 22 years and the longest lapse of employment I've had (once) was about 2 weeks over the last 10 years).  Then Gus proceeded to say \"We can still get you in to a late model low milage car, if you're interested I can compile a list\"... We said 'sure, it would be worth a look'... well, he came back and said \"the best one they had we \"qualified\" for is a Suzuki Forenza\" ... come to find out it is a 2005 or 2006 with about 160,000 miles on it ... it was everything I could do to maintain composure...like we were so desperate we would jump on something that was worth less than the down payment we were going to pay on the new Outlander Sport\n\nThen to add Insult to Injury ... I got a text the next day saying \"We have recieved your request and have som GREAT NEWS!!! Please call us, CONGRATS!!!...\n\nNeedless to say, I have a loan on a 2013 Harley Davidson (they were willing to take a chance) in \"Good Standing\" so my credit score is increasing, and when it gets in to the mid to upper 700's where I want it, I WON'T GO TO ANY PLANET AUTOMOTIVE DEALERSHIP!!!\n\nGo somewhere else and save yourself the anguish ...",

There is always a long line inside because 1 teller is on duty. If you're lucky, a 2nd teller may be around, but for the most part, they come up to you while you wait in line to encourage you to use the indoor ATMs. Pretty personable, right?\n\nI'm not going to lie, I really do enjoy walking into banks where there are 5-6 employees behind the counter and most of them will know your name. If I'm in a hurry, I'll use the outdoor or drive thru ATM. But honestly, this place is ran by a bunch of robots.",

We walked in at 12pm and left the bank at around 130pm. Granted there were a lot of things we had to do but there were only 2 personal bankers which is why we waited a long time to be helped. The banker however was nice, friendly and personable so it offsets the long wait and slow service. I recommend coming in on a weekday when there are more associates or come in earlier on a Saturday and be prepared to wait!",

Immediately when I entered the shop I was greeted by Greg who determined my needs and picked out the perfect plant - but it wasn't in a suitable arrangement for gift giving.  Greg at first thought he didn't have a proper container in which to present so he quickly searched his stock finding one lone wicker basket (which needed some modifications), repotting it, and applying 'leaf shine' spray.   With 2 lilies about to open, the arrangement was beautiful.  The peace lily was presented to our boss last week and he truly appreciated it!\n\nWhen my husband presents floral arrangements to me, he always uses The Dancing Dandelion.  However, this was the first time I'd ever visited their store.  I can see why he's a repeat customer.  I appreciate how fast Greg was able to troubleshoot the matter while ensuring that I left happy & satisfied. This family run business is top-notch and I would not hesitate to call on them in the future!",

I knew my best friend loves purple so i tried my best to find close to it. \n\nThe workers are super nice and tried to help me find what i wanted. I've always liked lilies and i thought it was a nice that they had an arrangement with roses and lillies. Its not the purple i had in mind but it worked out in the end. The lilies were white edged with a purple that was fairly close to the roses. They helped suggest what would look best (especially since i asked for purple roses) and what not (hey i havent bought anyone nice flowers in ages ! so i asked quite a bit of questions to make sure they know what i wanted and i knew what i was getting). The guy said they had a limited amount of purple roses but guaranteed they would have enough for my order. *crosses fingers* \n\nOrder was placed and paid for and they said i can pick it up any time day of. \n\nOur plan was, we had dinner scheduled at 6pm so i'd pick it up as close as i could to it. I found out they closed at 4pm on Saturdays but they said they'd be open longer for pick ups. I didn't want to be THAT guy who holds up the entire store from getting off work so i picked up the flowers at 3:30. Originally on order, i had asked for a wrapped bouquet but when i picked it up, it was in a water filled glass vase. Oh man how am i gonna give it to her at dinner? Lol But they recommended this would keep its shape the best so i went with it. \n\nThe flowers held up in the car. the owner? suggested how to put it in the car and how to make it stay put in the seat. The flowers sat in the car with some windows cracked open (oh man they smelled strong XD especially in a \"confined\" space like a car) XD o well. luckily my nose didnt go FUUUUU! lol XD They held up all night and next day til she went home. \n\nOnly downside about lilies is they didnt last as long as the roses and the pistils? tend to fall off and stain whatever they fall on :( sad face ! hope she liked the flowers XD \n\nOverall back to the store. Great customer service ! :D",

I've picked up flowers here on numerous occasions and always had a great experience!  The staff is knowledgeable and genuinely helpful.  DDFS was easily able to accommodate special requests for me on a couple of instances. Even when they didn't have what I was looking for they willfully pointed me in a helpful direction.  \n\nCustomer service is top notch...as another example, for a nominal fee they will even clean-up and prepare potted plants purchased from Plant Nurseries, Home Depot, etc. making them gift ready.  Prices are slightly above average for flower shops, but spot on when you consider the quality product and service that accompanies your orders.  \n\nThey deserve a very strong 4 Stars in my book.  The shop is on the small side and their on-hand inventory is a little limited because of this, but if you can give them a couple of days the sky's the limit.",

After they spoke with their distributor, they were going to order from out of the country. But being as it was coming from out of the country, they could not guarantee the quality. Long story short, the fresh lavender quality was not top notch. They still made the bouquet but did not charge us full price. \n\nOur back up plan was using dried lavender stalks to make the bridal bouquet and this worked out perfectly. I actually like idea better because I am now using the dried lavender bouquet as a floral display at home. Every time I see it, it reminds me of our special day. \n\nIf you need a good florist, you should see and talk to the folks at Dancing Dandelion!",

It took about a month to have the repair completed which cost them about 3000 dollars. All of the replacement parts were after market or used. Its been two years now and the car is still not right. \nWhen Progressive first looks at my car they did not document all of the damage. When the repair shop founf the extent of it, at every step the adjuster had to  verify the damage and then approve payment . This took many subsequent visits by the adjuster. This also causes the repair service a lot of time and they  likly skiped some repairs. Progressive is a nightmare if you have a claim. Ask them the formula they use if you total your car, OMG ask them. I found the same Insurance at a very well know Nation Wide company at a much lower cost.

They were able to quote me a \"Normal\" rate for the type of driver I am (I was suspended for 4 years, 7 years ago, and didn't renew until 1.5 years ago as I did not need it) when every other company was like $6/$7k/yr!!!!!!!!  I bought the car for recreational purposes ONLY, only paid $9k for it and plan on putting maybe 6k on it this year, do not use it for work, but wanted the freedom I haven't had in so long.  When I called and spoke to the reps at Progressive they were all quite literally SHOCKED to hear the quotes I had been given and even pointed out that the only reason my insurance was \"So expensive\" through them is due to a ticket 2yrs 11mos and 28 days ago, so if I waited 3 days my rate should go down.  Sure as shit I re-did the numbers starting my policy the next Friday, saved ANOTHER $400 and am on the road this weekend...  My dealership dealt with them but said they were quick and a pleasure, hopefully they're as good as they say if I get hit!!!!!  Loving Progressive right now, time to go for a cruise :0)))",

    "text": "wow, I can't believe these people can still be in business!  I will try to summarize my interactions... My 70yr old mother was hit by a progressive insured driver.  Took her car to progressive to get it fixed.  They then informed us the car would be totaled because to repair a trunk and bumper was more expensive then the vehicle was to replace.  Surprised at the low valuation (and check offered), I ran my own comps and requested their reports.  In their comps they willfully low-balled our vehicle by saying it didn't have AC, sunroof, CD player, power windows etc. ALL to get a lower valuation!!  APPALLING!  Talked to two other insurance providers and two auto body shop and ALL said that Progressive is notorious for being the biggest lowballers in the bisiness.  Upon calling them out on the \"oversight\" they adjusted their numbers and ran new comps - only to have their mystery software give a LOWER number... \n\nI then supplied them with NADA valuations, KBB valuations, and EVERY single same make/model car that was being sold across the nation as comps (all for 30% more).  And their response was \"my comps didn't take into account individual markets and mileage.  I am simply appalled at how horrible this company is - and even elevating it to supervisors, and the BBB produced no further results.  They just hide behind the fact that their software is \"state approved\".  Within 3 days of dropping off the vehicle Progressive forced us to return the rental car, threatened to have our car towed off their property, and sent us the settlement check because they didn't want to discuss it further.  \n\nI really hope someone with more $$ then us takes these criminals to court.",

One of the \"discounts\" which is included in their basic quote which they don't tell you you need to do until towards the end of signing up is to sign your documents electronically.  When I tried to do that from Linux, the Progressive website kept failing.  I spoke with a woman at Progressive customer service(?) for about 10 minutes.  She kept arguing with me that I needed to run Windows.  Why in the world should it matter for car insurance what computer operating system I run at home?!?  Finally, I spoke with her boss who allowed me to sign the documents offline and still get the discount.  What a bunch of fudge.\n\nI had left Progressive after they raised my rate 27% a few years ago just because I was a good customer.  The Progressive customer service(?) guy told me there had been TWO rate increases within the six months I had insurance with them.  So I dumped Progressive.\n\nNow I am looking for car insurance again.  I got a good quote from Progressive.  But just before I went to purchase insurance with them today, they raised the quote more than 30 PERCENT(!!!) just because they found a NOT AT FAULT accident on my record from three years ago.  (By the way, I never even made a claim with my or the other guy's car insurance for that accident.  He forced me into a median, totaled my old car, and then lied to the Travis County, Texas police who screamed at me for five minutes until I thanked them for coming out.  Those Travis County police officers didn't seem to like me because of my flowery shirt indicating I am gay.  I took about a $6000 loss on my car; the other guy who was a bully only suffered a broken drivers side mirror.  But that is beside the point.)  Can I charge you for something that was not your fault?!?\n\nBS!  Enough with Progressive.  I keep feeling like they are Lucy holding the football for me kick but then they pull it away time and time again so I can fall on my backside.\n\nProgressive does have good rates when you are a new customer and can get through all their hoops.  But otherwise, they are worth avoiding.\n\nUpdate: as I get quotes from other companies, so far Progressive is lowest for my car, circumstances, and location even with the 30% increase due to the not at fault accident on my record.  So I am bumping them up from two stars to three.  If I do go with Progressive and I can sign my documents without the mess I had last time, I will bump them up another star.",

It's about 4PM Monday afternoon.\n\nThe guy is very apologetic, takes full responsibility for the accident and gives Sue all his info - a real mensch.  By the time Sue gets home, there's a v-mail from a Progressive Adjuster asking Sue to call him.  They have Sue an appointment the next day at the body shop.  \n\nWhen she takes the car to the shop Tuesday morning, the folks there  call Enterprise rental car, who then comes and picks Sue up, takes her to their lot where she gets a rental car.  Thursday, mid-morning, the body shop calls to tell her the car is done.  She drops the rental back at Enterprise, Enterprise drops Sue back at the body shop and by 4PM Thursday, Sue's fully repaired car is sitting in the garage.  Three days from rough to buff!!  Simply amazing.\n\nAll through the process the Progressive adjuster was checking in with Sue, visiting the body shop to check on the car, etc.  We are really impressed with the level of customer service Progressive provided - and Sue wasn't even their customer.  Sue and I both agree that if you're going to get hit by someone, make sure they have Progressive insurance !!\n\nAs far as I am concerned, this is my new gold standard for auto insurance.  If my rates weren't so low with Farmers, I'd sign up with Progressive in a heartbeat.  Next time you're in the auto insurance market - check 'em out!",

If you're driving 45 MPH and brake at a constant 7 MPH / second, you will need 280 feet to completely stop. Progressive thinks you're \"hard braking\" if you have less than a football field to stop.

It may cause them to hesitate in a situation where a hard brake is required to avoid an accident. \n\nWhile I really like the concept of insurance rates being affected by real-world driving data, this system is so poorly thought out (counting 8 MPH/second as a \"hard brake\") that the only way to avoid getting beeped is to drive dangerously under the speed limit. \n\nThe final straw for me was when Snapshot claimed I was \"hard-braking\" while pulling into my driveway.",

If some douchewallet scrapes your fender and you need to get it painted, an adjuster will usually make it out to the bodyshop within two or three days to pay for the damage, reducing the time you need to take buses or taxis.\n\nWhy you SHOULDN'T choose Progressive:\n\n- Really slow customer service. If your car is broken down in the middle of the road and you're calling Progressive to send you some roadside assistance, it's not uncommon to be on hold for ten minutes or more, while people are honking at you and telling you to get a horse.\n\n- If you DO call Progressive to send you roadside assistance, count on the operator saying \"they'll be there in thirty minutes\". Then count on help actually arriving two hours later. (NOT hyperbole)\n\n- Even if you pay a huge premium each month to protect yourself, Progressive will fight you tooth and nail to save themselves a few bucks on repairing your dented bumper, at a cost of time and increase in blood pressure for you.\n\n- Speaking of which, count on Progressive to try to tell you that your one year old Audi A4 is a \"total loss\" so that they can give you $3000 scrap value instead of paying to fix your door. Seriously, WTF?\n\n- Their spokeswoman, the beehive-sporting \"Flo\", will haunt your dreams.\n\nBasically, when it comes right down to it, Progressive is decent insurance if you just want to prove to the policeman who pulled you over that you're legally insured to drive a vehicle.\n\nWalking in a straight line and following the pen-light is still up to you...\n\n-- but for serious insurance, buy Triple A, which is what I'm going to do now (and which is what I should have done, FIRST).\n\nStay safe, hottie.

I used Progressive's suggested repair shop  - Safelite Auto Glass - and the repair was not done to my satisfaction as I could hear glass rattling around within the back hatch of the car. I was unable to reach inside this back door myself with a vacuum and I expected the clean up to be done during the repair- apparently Safelite does not have this capability.  In addition to being an irritant this is also a safety hazard, so I went to the Audi dealership for them to blow out the remaining glass shards using compressed air. Progressive did not reimburse me for the full amount (after deductable) stating that they had an estimate from a different shop for a lesser amount. Then why didn't they send me to this shop to being with? I don't have time to travel around at Progressive's whim to repair centers I neither know nor trust to complete a job that should have been done right the first time. To add insult to injury, the callous Progressive representative I spoke with over the phone said that Progressive does not normally pay for clean up and I should be happy with what I got. This was only a simple glass claim - what would be the attitude with a more serious claim? If this unacceptable cavalier service is how Progressive is able to keep the costs of their policies down then I want no part of it. I can guarantee today that I will not be renewing this policy in July 2017.",

    "text": "I would score Progressive lower if possible.  We bought a new 5th wheel RV and had it insured through Progressive.  It never left the dealer lot as we had some work done to the RV and had the insurance one week when Progressive canceled it suddenly.  The reason Progressive gave us is that since we were using it two to three weeks a year it was declared our primary home.  When asked where we were supposed to be living the other 49 weeks of the year, they said that was not their problem since the RV was our primary home.  We will not recommend or use a company that thinks that three weeks a year is a primary home.  When we talked to another representative she could not explain why they canceled the policy, but indicated that we must have told them that the RV was going to be our primary home because they would not have made that type of mistake.  No matter how you figure it Three weeks is not even close to 52 weeks a year and Progressive just made themselves look like unprofessional incompetent people.  WE WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!",

    "text": "I am writing you because I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the service I received from Progressive after my accident. When my car was returned the first time, I complained because there was a noise coming from the right side of my car (the side hit in the accident and had been \"completely\" repaired). It sounded like a popping noise and metal rubbing together, I brought my car back to the service center, it was sent back to the mechanic and upon my vehicles return I was told the mechanic could not find anything wrong and I would have to pay a dealership to do a diagnostic and then only if the dealership told Progressive that it was accident related would it be covered and possibly the cost of the diagnostic. Which did not make any sense to me because the noise was coming from the side I was hit on and it was not making that noise before the accident or at the sense of the accident. I continued to drive my car while I saved to pay additional money for a diagnostic from a dealership. A few weeks go by and the noise has intensified and was constant, there was a new additional noise being made every time I put the vehicle in reverse. \nI called your 1800 number and explained that there is something wrong and the Progressive Representative told me \"your car does not sound like it is safe to be driving please bring it back to the center for repairs.\" With a sigh of relief I do just that upon arrival my car is driven by an employee they acknowledge that the sound is not right and there is something wrong, then proceed to tell me there is nothing they can or would be willing to do and I have to take it to a dealership because the mechanic will not find anything wrong. I was floored, to say the least, how could the mechanic not find something wrong the car screeches and makes noise whenever in motion.  Also an employee of Progressive told me to bring the car back for repairs!! I left infuriated \nI took my car in for an oil change to Big O Tires and asked them to take a look while they were working on it and guess what... MAGICALLY they found something! My rear right brake pad was badly damaged due to \"scrap metal\" being wedged in it and the rotor was broken due the extreme damage from the metal. $300 dollars later Big O was able to replace the rotor and brake pad and my car is like new. \nI find it unacceptable that your \"mechanic\" was not able to figure that out forcing me to pay an additional $300 dollars for my car to be fixed. Not to down play the employees of Big O Tires but if they can figure out this issue that your mechanic said didn't exist, it may be time to send your customers cars to someone new and step it up! I cannot even give the benefit of the doubt that everyone makes mistakes because when my car was returned the very first time there was a MASSIVE crack in my windshield that required me to take it back in, that was the free pass. For this accident I had to take my car back 4 times due to this being handled poorly, I was lead to believe that customer service was something Progressive prided itself on. That is not something that I experienced at all. \n\nI would like to know if I will be reimbursed for the rotor and brake pads that I had to pay to be replaced after my accident repairs. I feel like I should receive a reimbursement due to the fact I tried twice to have your \"mechanic\" fix this issue and my rotor would not have had to be replaced if it was taken care of when I took it back the first time.",

Any time I have canceled for any reason with other insurance companies, I have received a nice check in the mail for the remainder of the policy.  Not Progressive.  I canceled our motorcycle insurance a whole month early because we sold the bike.  I got an email back from Progressive stating that they are charging us a $30 cancellation fee.  Wha??  $30 to cancel a $250/year policy, with only one month left?  I called & spoke to a robotic, non-apologetic customer service rep who stated that the $30 fee stands & they will be sending me a final bill.  I'm pretty sure that bill will get \"lost in the mail\" cuz there's no way I'm paying it.\n\nBTW I hate Flo, too.",

    "text": "I had a very bad experience with Progressive Claim Department.  This auto insurance has a very weird policy: if there is an incident, even if it is obvious there is no way it may cause bodily injuries, if there is a claim for such, the insurance pays them the minimum liability $700 for bodily injuries even if it is fraud or a lie.  Check out very carefully their liability - it literally says \"even if it is fraud or a lie\".  \n\nThis happened to me when backing out of a parking space touched another parked car.  The police did not give me any tickets, we were asked to exchange insurance info.  I reported the incident to the claim department and the associate assured me it was a minor incident of no consequence. \n\nThe other car owners were outside of the car, even one of them inside a store.  These two people kept screaming at the top of their  lungs and acting as if something terrible had happened.  They started hitting and kicking my car .  \n\nOrdered by the police these two persons were asked to stay inside the car till I took pictures of their bumper, which I sent to my insurance.  There were NO damages on the bumper! NO damages!\n\nI stayed in touch with the CD for a while, and I was always assured this was a minor incident.  Only three months later I learned quite by chance from another source, my driving record had registered \"bodily injury\".  Calling back the CD, the supervisor told me what their policy was and he added: as ridiculous as it is, we have to pay them, even we know that kind of incident can never cause any sort of injuries, we have to pay them so that they do not pursue other claims and don't sue us\".\n\nI tried to fight it as much as I could but Progressive defended this ridiculous policy of theirs and even when they admitted there was no way I could have caused any injuries, they still did not fix my driving record.  \n\nThis is clearly a policy that invites wrongdoers to have their way and make an easy breezy 700 bucks!  Thank God there are plenty of other auto insurances out there!",

    "text": "I got into a car accident, and the person who was in the accident with me has Progressive Insurance. Thank goodness I have Allstate (their customer service is AMAZING, i noticed that after this experience). Having to deal with Progressive was nothing short of a nightmare.\nPolice were called to the accident scene, they determined 50/50 liability for the accident (half my fault and half the other person's fault). They inspected the vehicles themselves and the position they were in. Allstate, my insurance company, determined 50/50 liability based on the evidence I provided them.\nProgressive, on the other hand, determined it was 100% my fault. No questions, no options, they wouldn't budge on the decision. Somehow out of thin air this was completely my fault.\nNOT ONLY did they falsely blame me for the accident (so that way, they don't have to pay for any of my damages) BUT Xavier (his direct line: (813)371-4022) was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. When I asked to have my vehicle inspected by Progressive, his EXACT response was \"Well, we aren't going to cover it anyway, so we're not going to inspect it.\" Talk about SCUMBAG customer service. Even when I explained to him how the accident went down, he said \"What you're saying doesn't make any sense.\" Maybe I started speaking a foreign language while I was on the phone with him, who knows. I will never deal with Progressive or Xavier and his unapologetic, uptight schoolgirl demeanor. If you're going to be employed by a company, at least attempt to act like an adult and provide solutions to people. Provide customer service... You can guarantee everyone I know will hear about this. Progressive seems to have a crappy reputation anyway, so I doubt they will care to change much. The way it looks, they already have this problem enough. I guess that's what happens when you employ a bunch of greedy, useless lowlifes to work for a scumbag corporation. You get treated like dirt!",

    "text": "First off I want to say: I will never be a Progressive customer again in my life. Never. And I will actively, now and forever, try to deter potential customers. I've already switched my SOs and brothers car, rental and motorcycle policies from Progressive as well. You'll notice I have an active motorcycle policy? Yup, that's gone too. The new truck and my other 3 motorcycles sitting in my garage (one being brand new)? Yes, I will be covering those under someone else, too. It is not enough of a Risk Transference to be 'covered' through Progressive. I was a customer for YEARS, and enjoyed my customer experience enough to recommend it to anyone for insurance needs because the price was alright and I never had a bad experience, that is until I had my first and only claim with you. \n\nMy experience was 100% terrible. There wasn't a good moment through the entire process. Not once. Your customer service was rude. It was extremely difficult to go through them to get a claim agent on the line who could even do anything. The claim agents were also rude and not helpful (think \"Computer Says 'No'\" from Little Britain). And end the end? My claim was denied, because \"my policy didn't cover it.\" It did cover the damages?! It absolutely did cover the damages. At the beginning of financing this vehicle I was required to get full coverage. I had the lender AND the dealer fax the copy over to the number the representative their copies of my original policy. Not only was my policy changed, but Progressive completely denied actually changing my policy!! AND I was still paying the amount for the ORIGINAL coverage!\n\nYou'd think that I must have had an accident that would have caused Progressive so much cost in damages I'd be a liability to keep as a customer, right? No. I grazed a pillar in a parking garage. The repair bill came out to just over $900 on my cheap $14,000 car. My original deductible was $500. It would have only been a $400 and some change bill vs a $900 bill. That's nothing. If my rate would have gone up more than the $400 in the next two years I'd have paid it out of pocket even. But it's the principal of the issue. You were rude. You were unhelpful. You were impossible to get a hold of and to get an update out of unless I was breathing down your neck multiple times a week. And you didn't provide me the services I very clearly paid for, in a legally definisble way. I have the copies of the original policy that my lender and dealer provided me. You have the copies of the original policy that my lender and dealer provided you. You're damn right I'd have sued if it were worth the time and effort, but dropping you as a customer and switching all of the policies I pay for ended up saving me that $900 over a 14 month period.   \n\nOver the 7 years I've been a customer, I've paid probably $8,000 to you. I hope you enjoy that $8,000 - because you weren't there for me in transferring liability when I needed you. I've made it a personal mission to take at least 4 times of that out of you by convincing and deterring potential customers, whether in person or over social media. I'll just include the evidence I have, and let it speak for itself so they can form their own opinion. The copy of my policy with the $500 collision and comprehensive deductible and the list of coverage and your terrible (and slow) responses and emails. People should know there is a very real possibility they won't be covered under an insurance policy that clearly states they'd be covered, or that their policy can get changed magically at any time without them being aware of it (or being recorded by Progressive). That should be illegal, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is. \n\nI can't even imagine what would have happened if I a serious claim. You can see why I'd be this upset. $900 is nothing, It was my first EVER claim I've had and I was treated like shit.  \n\nYou and your rude and non-responsive customer service can shove it. I feel like I've been robbed.",

I took the agency's word that they were working out the problem. A couple weeks go by and I call Paul to find out what the progress is and he blows me off with a promise to \"get back to me\". When he didn't get back to me  I receive a notice from AmFam that my newly added policy is in jeopardy of being cancelled. I immediately call the associate who promises to get back to me with a resolution and the amount that I have to pay to become current. I never receive a call of course and contact AmFam's 800 number. The phone agent explains to me that I am a little over a month behind and that my policy was suspended 2 days prior. I get everything worked out in 15 min on the customer service call than I did in two weeks with a LOCAL agent. The last order of business was to fire my agent through phone customer service and write in to the notes to Paul's manager the reason why I will never use Paul G's AmFam agency again.",

    "text": "First of all their website should say they do not process re-loan or previous customers online.  They direct to call their customer service line and they then \"Pre-Approve\" you and tell you an amount, precede to send you to a store located near you (misfortune was store 412). They tell you need to bring proof of income, bank statement, id, debit card. I was told an amount I was approved for. I go to the godforsaken store of 412 and had the most unpleasant, disrespectful, unprofessional encounter ever with Diana (who claimed later she was store manager, shame on Cash 1 if she is!). Long horrible store short, she basically harassed me for nothing because I ended up leaving the store without the loan. She is rude and definitely needs some customer service, basic people skills, and common sense training! I asked for the corporate # and she was like it's on the pen, I'm the store manager they are just going to refer you back to me. I left there almost in tears! I called the corporate office and left a message. I went to another store 415, they were going to give me the amount I was preapproved for but then I was told because of what Diana did they could only give me half, which I need assistance is still leaving me in a bind and while Joshua was helpful at 415 I still can't give cash 1 a positive review based on my experience even after I spoke to the regional manager. They don't communicate well because I was told some many different things and wasted a lot of my time. had I known I would still be short I might have been able to spend my time looking for other options. Although she seemed sympathetic, i don't believe they will do any thing different because why should they? They know you are in a hard place or you wouldn't be there and they can just lie and treat you anyway they please.",

The best part is that most of what I need to do can be handled via email so I don't have to take time off. He's very polite and I don't feel rushed. The amount I pay is reasonable and the company that he found for us has also been great. We were in an accident that was our fault but rates didn't increase to an outrageous amount. This office has been great since the first day and continues to exceed expectations! Thank you",

She has been especially helpful with clients who are handling final tax returns as personal representative of a probate.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about Jessica and her team is how often they communicate with us throughout the year to make sure we are taking the most advantage of our payroll, quarterly taxes, deductions, etc. If she sees we are doing something wrong in our Quickbooks we are able to quickly adjust without waiting until \"tax- time.\" This proactive approach gives me confidence that she is truly concerned about my business and our goals. Her tax and accounting counsel and advice makes her stand out from other individuals who have merely just filed our returns at the end of the year.\n\nIf you are looking for a proactive accountant/tax person for either your personal returns or business, I highly recommend Accounting Services by ACP.",

Is that a rip off? Yes of course it is. But thats how stores make money, pay their employees, and how one gets cash money fast (hint: use Craigslist for fair market prices). Try to negotiate at least 50% if you have desirable stuff or solicit here often. I don't do jewelry so no experience here. \n\nSelection is often better than most but small--the usual tools, electronics, jewelry. Some decent guitars every so often. Prices are on steep side, negotiate whenever you can. They have some flexibility, unlike Super Pawn. Service is lacking but generally good for what it is: a pawn store. Oh, yeah, no grace period. Return policy not too shabby but make sure you establish terms up-front. \n\nPro tip: always hard case your guitars, or otherwise  protect your pawned gear, most folks don't care about your stuff until too late.",

    "text": "All banks conduct legalized fraud, but PNC does it under the radar.  This review has been a long time coming, but unfortunately, you won't care what I say until it happens to you. :)  Let's start with ATM's, you wanna use one?  Then you better use a PNC or an extra $2.50+ fee will be added on top of what ever the other ATM charges you.  That's right, lets say your in Tokyo (only 1 bank in the heart of Tokyo will accept your card anyway,  all others will fail ) and they say $5.00 fee (in Yen), well PNC will tag on their own $2.50+ just because they can.  What dicks you say? well let me also say another thing about international travel.  DON'T USE YOUR PNC CARD INTERNATIONALLY.  PNC uses Visa which they decided to set a 3% charge too.  So spend $100 PNC will take $3, ON EVERY PURCHASE.  My previous international travel bank Fidelity has since sold out, but before they only charged a 1% fee.  Before you laugh and giggle about pocket change then picture this.  International at that you can only pull out up to $200 from, sub-track 10% (3%+ ATM Fees) of that and realize that it goes directly into the pockets of your financial institution, of which your money is supposed to keep afloat while they rob you blind any which way they can.\n\nSheetz ATM surcharge free?  Think again, Sheetz won't charge you, but PNC will. .",

PNC is reasonably profitable, so why can't they spend a little cash to clean up their parking lot, plant some new trees (they let the current ones die), and pick up the thousands of cigarette butts from the front of their building?   I'm not asking for a renovation of the place, but a bank building should inspire confidence in what they're doing inside.  I wouldn't trust these guys with the bowl of pennies on my dresser.",

Our insurance company, Farmer's, assigned us to a contact at CRS who was supposed to help us find a place to stay. I emailed them several potential properties that I had researched myself and they promised they would look into them. When I didn't hear from them the next day (we were supposed to move asap) I emailed and they assured me they were looking into it. The next day they assigned me to a \"level 2\" specialist since inventory was hard to find, but that person did not even try to contact me for two days after. I ended up booking a place myself on Air BnB -- it was one of the properties I had sent them and the person renting it got back to me within 30 minutes of me emailing them. My experience was CRS was less than helpful -- it was a total waste of my time.",

Her card did tell us her work and cell phone number, but she never exclusively said we could call her cell, so it was alittle awkward calling her cell, especially since she never answered her work phone. I gave her two stars because she was very nice and attempted to answer all our questions. The main reason why we called was to get down payment assistance and she didn't even check for that, then my realtor tried calling her, both numbers, and it's officially been a week. Not one answer. Very disappointing, especially since we told her we were on a time crunch as well. Maybe the company isn't bad, but Cindy made us (first time home buyers) feel that we weren't important and that maybe she had better things to do.",

But, never got a response. The reviews are what made me want to go with Starboard Financial, but I see now they are probably fake and done by employees and their families.

The lady I spoke with said yes and that she would hold the money under my name for me until I could pick it up. I told her I would be in within a few days and thanked her for her time.\n\nI went in on the day I asked and when I opened the door I said \"Hi, I called on Monday and someone said they were going to hold some currency aside for me until I could come in today and get it.\" The lady sitting at the back desk responded very rudely and abruptly with \"And?!?!?!? What am I supposed to do with that information?\" I said \"Well um, ok then...\" and she then asked \"can I at least have your name or something? How am I supposed to know who you are?\" After I gave her the information she asked for, she went to the back and got the currency, and returned. She was a lot nicer to me after she returned. It was almost alarming actually how quickly her personality changed. Regardless, there is zero excuse for this behavior. That is not how you treat customers, especially customers who are not being rude to you. \n\nThe office is a little difficult to find, but there are lots of people around and they will easily show you the way if you get lost from the parking garage. The office itself was clean and well kept. They validate your parking which is a nice bonus. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the exchange rates here are AMAZING.

Whenever I travel abroad I do some research on exchange rates in the country I'm visiting vs this joint.  9 times out of 10 they are very competitive with their rates and I'd rather exchange large sums of currency in Vegas than in a foreign country.\n\nI was here the other day to convert some US Dollars to Chinese RMB in preparation for an upcoming trip to China.  I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.  They were offering 6.53 RMB to 1 USD.  Luckily, I had a classmate in Beijing that just exchanged some currency the day before and she said the exchange rate at banks in Beijing was 6.45-6.75 RMB to 1 USD.  Not a bad deal!  I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.\n\nOne of the bad things about this place is the parking.  If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.  That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.  \n\nWhich leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.  There is a large counter in the office where you conduct your transactions and a large window facing the street where people can look inside and see what you're doing. (see pics)  Not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.  I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.\n\nOverall Value - they offer great exchange rates, I'm always satisfied with the value they offer.\n\nWill I return?

I parked in the building next to it underneath it has plenty of visitor parking.  $1.00 for the first 30 minutes which is all you need.  It used to be you can just park across the street for free and walk across but now there is so much road construction and what used to be a parking lot is torn up right now.  I would recommend going to this place over others.  Banks don't have certain currencies in stock and you have to order it a week in advance.  Not at this place.  It's available for same day service.  No appointment necessary.  Just walk in.",

We had a lot of coin, but... newbies that we are to currency exchange, we learned the only currency they can take is paper... no coins... Best advice to travelers is to use ALL the coin you have in country and only bring paper \"bills\" back with you :).   The location is rather nondescript and we must have been oblivious to any signage once we parked the car in the garage as we \"finally\" found FME by asking a postal worker walking by:).  They are located on the FIRST floor if the \"PALACE\" building at 101 Convention Center Drive... not the \"Tower\" building... We got a little exercise finding the place :).  I must say, the gals running the front office there were wonderful, sweet, and very knowledgable... We exchanged currency from Poland, England, and Canada without issue and at a very fair rate... We were glad we checked Yelp for advice before we went elsewhere... We know enough not to exchange money at airport$$, but weren't sure if local banks could help us out... Apparently they aren't in the business much anymore, if at all... My daughter enjoyed the memorabilia on the walls... I would recommend FME to anyone with foreign currency needs... The gals are sweethearts and will treat you very well...and even validated our parking!",

I received 6.36 to the dollar with no fees.  That is not even a 2% spread.  How anyone can say this place is not the best in town is beyond me.  Apparently, anyone who disagrees does not travel or change money often.  I have used this place at least 10 times already for trips to Tahiti, China, several trips to Europe, Hong Kong and Japan.  Everytime I get by far the best rate, and there is NO surcharge, NO fees. \n\nI WILL concede sometimes they are a little gruff on the phone, but they are pleasant in store, especially when you are a regular.  There is absolutely no way a casino offered the same rate as this place.  Next time you are changing money, call this place and ask for the rate on a given currency and then call or go to an American Express travel exchange place or similar locale, and make sure you ask about any fees, surcharges etc.",

The parking garage is directly across the street from the Somerset Shopping sign.  Just a tip, when you pull in and get your parking ticket, park in the first available spot as you drive in.  Then walk out where you drove in and you will see the Tower building in front of you.  (They moved buildings).  It's a shorter walk than going through the garage and going up the elevators.  Don't forget your parking garage ticket so they can validate.\n\nThe lady was friendly and gave a receipt breaking down my transaction. She even exchanged my random Australian money I had.

Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would \"take care of us\" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.\n\nIf you love being lied to, then Chase is the way to go for your mortgage! I had a terrible experience getting a mortgage at Chase. I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us. \n\nIf I could go back, I would have gone to a federal credit union for my mortgage.",

A loss for the community, I guess, but economics get to us every day, don't they?",

    "text": "I've had the worst experience at the East Tropicana location, for starters aside from one banker named Shane the whole staff is worthless. Headed by \"branch manager\" \"vice president\" Kristin Leupold who was extremely unprofessional, unhelpful & a down right weak excuse for a manager. I felt very uncomfortable with her handling my customer service issue, she came off inexperienced & did not appear to be an authority figure what so ever. When I saw her card I was shocked, whoever put her in that type of leadership role is no Einstein let me tell you that. \n\nNow for my story, so I tried depositing my paycheck at an atm at this location the machine ate my check & didnt register anything in the account. So I went inside & for hours went in circles with Kristin until she finally credited my account for the eaten check. A month later chase reverses the credit & completely wrecks my account naturally I was upset. I showed up at the bank with a fresh paycheck I needed cashed for thanksgiving & to resolve the issue. Shane helped me get some cash from my check & assured me Kristin who was on vacation at the time would straighten out my account when she returned on Friday that was Wednesday. On Friday I needed to pay my rent so I went in expecting Kristin to recredit my account since it was chases fault the machine ate my check & the credit never should have been reversed in the first place. Again Shane assured me Kristin would fix the issue or I never would have deposited my check there being that I needed to pay rent. Kristin acted completely oblivious to the situation when I arrived, she then kept on repeating herself that she could not issue a credit. I told her calmly I wasn't leaving without my hard earned money I needed for my rent. I sat down & told her to call her boss again. She's such a coward she sent out a little college student teller to tell me nothing could be done for me & the police were on the way to escort me out. Yes, that's how chase treats their customers when you come for the money that is rightfully yours they call the cops to have you escorted out. After this issue is resolved I will never bank with chase again & I will make sure that everyone I come in contact with knows how bad their customer service is. DONT BANK WITH CHASE UNLESS YOU WANT TO CHASE THEM FOR YOUR MONEY.",

    "text": "I've been open since Nov 2013 and DRSS really helped me through the process of finding a location, financing, my leasing contract, merchandising, ordering and building/setting up my store and many other things.  Unlike owning a franchise, I felt I had a say in every step of the process and at any point IF I wanted to I could've stopped and said No to anything I didn't like/agree with.  Some owners might not like having a merchandise package pre-set for their 1st order/opening but it's truly the best way.  No one knows based on your location what is gonna be hot or not.  Just because it's hot in many other locations it might not be the hot item for your store.  So after the initial opening, you have 100% freedom to re order an item or choose something different based on customer feedback.  This isn't a franchise, do what you want. There is no sure thing in anything you do.  I've learned for my particular store to have a small amount of an item but have lots of variety and it has been great for me.  Some vendors might not be so flexible with having smaller case sizes for what you want and we've learned that there are SO many choices/other vendors to order from out there that we typically end up much happier than getting stuck with lots of something that didn't end up selling.  DRSS is very helpful anytime I need to call and ask for advice with a product or vendor or a display or anything at all.  Remember it's advice, it's not a franchise, do what you want. Some things work out great, others don't. You really just have to keep talking to your customers and find out what is popular for your location.  I also HIGHLY recommend attending trade shows like toyfest and ASD here in Las Vegas (they are here twice a year).  This gives you a chance to meet with current and new vendors, touch and play with new merchandise that might interest you and you can do this on your own or a representative of DRSS can spend time with you to help you as well, it's totally your choice.  All I can end with is what you get out of your business depends on the effort you put into it. It doesn't run itself.  Thank you DRSS for what you've helped me with and the flexibility to do what I want with my own business.",

It has quite the .... different design than a normal bank.... Upon entry through the main double doors, you have the ATM to the left, a wall in front of you, and another set of doors to the right. After going through those doors, you have a huge wall leading you into a huge room. Bankers to the left, tellers to the right. According to the banker who helped me, this was the design of the previous WaMu. She described it as like a huge living room. xD\n\nI had came to Chase because I wanted to get the new Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card as its an amazing travel card (look it up !) As a currently holder of the Chase Freedom (5% CB quarterly) and Chase Sapphire Preferred, it was a great card to get and \"replace\" my Sapphire Preferred with. \n\nProcess was seamless and quick. Apparently i was already pre-approved for the Sapphire Reserve so it was essentially quick print and sign and i was on my way. Banker stated card will arrive in about a week in a non-labeled white envelope. My friends had told me it arrived by UPS either overnight or within the next day or two, which it did. \n\nSuper fast. Super easy. Time took here was less than the amount i waited at the other branch for someone to tell me they were \"busy\" and \"understaffed\"",

But our latest banking crisis lead to Wachovia being swallowed up by Chase, and now we have a bunch of these rebranded Chase locations around town.\n\nBefore today, I have never been inside this location, so I can't say what exactly they did to the interior of the bank. But it does not even look like a bank, in the traditional way.  Meaning no bulletproof barrier and counter separating you and the tellers. But there is still the counter with the deposit slips and courtesy pens to help you fill out your forms near the enterence.  There is still the rope and stanchion to queue banking customers on a busy day (which it was not on my visit just 10 minutes ago).\n\nAnyway, I thought it is kind of refreshing how Chase is going out of their way to try and make the banking experience more personable (at least at this location in Summerlin).\n\nThere are 3 tellers stations and one desk for the rep that is going to handle opening new accounts and what not.  And all of it is situated inside a large room without partition (not including the one in the front that helps block out the sun and some of the heat, once you get past the small ATM room.\n\nI don't bank here currently, but I may have to occassionally drop by to make deposits into my parents account in the future.  However I might down the road, seeing that there are hardly any HSBC locations in Las Vegas and the lines at Wells Fargo have always been crowded whenever I have to see a teller.",

I wanted my billing date changed to be in harmony with my other credit cards and to make my life easier. I was told that it was impossible. \n\nI asked how long ahead of time should I make my payments by online banking? I was told they required at least 3 weekdays to process a payment. Their payment are processed in the U.S., and that is just that.\n\nDo they have physical location where payment can be made? No!\n\nBut, I was told I can pay at any bank, but it will still take 3 days to process my payment.\n\nI asked if I could be with Capital One drafting my account monthly, so as not to worry while I travel. Another resounding no!\n\nI don't know why Costco, after stellar service from American Express would get into bed with these rascals?\n\nI am sure they will be charging a plethora of fees.\n\nFor those of you that have gotten their unlimited travel card, someone has just posted a warning. But here is the simple math of it. One travel mile with any airline has a market value of between $0.01 and $0.03 as a rough comparison tool. Most airlines will allow you to go anywhere in the U.S. for 25,000 miles. This ticket could cost anywhere from $350.00 to $2,000.00, that does not matter. It is still the same number of miles.\n\nThe Aspire Card does not come anywhere near giving you that kind of return, in spite of the their advertising. It is very, much like the Visa Royal Bank Avion card.\n\nJust beware of Capital One. For those of you who might be late paying, I am pretty sure we will be seeing \"American style\" financial penalties.",

    "text": "I would give zero stars. I have banked with SSCU for 11 years. Since they changed their computer system there has been nothing been trouble. Yesterday, I made a mobile deposit. Not only, did they not make all of the money available. They did not make the $200 available as their policy states. They charged me an overdraft charge and claimed that I made the deposit today instead of last night. I spoke with Daniel who insinuated that I was lying about putting the money in yesterday. He refused to resolve the situation. He said, \"Clearly, you do not understand how our bank works.\" He then explained that $200 was made available, but it was made available at 11:36 am today instead of when the deposit was made. He then said that the current disclosures, which are different than the disclosures I received 11 years ago, state all of this information. \nSo, the representative by the name of Daniel refused to correct the situation, acknowledged that I was being held to a disclosure agreement that I never received, and said he would not help me. He was more concerned about being right than correcting the BANK error. \n\nAccount will be closed at the end of the month. Worst banking situation I could ever imagine. \n\nBeyond the incompetence of Daniel the representative, I've had to have my card replaced over 5 times due to fraud. They DO NOT PROTECT YOUR MONEY.\n\nStay away from this catastrophe of a bank.",

I love my bank.\n\nI messed up at banks, just as I messed up at credit, when I was a wee lass and no one would give me an account.  I got a job at UNLV and was eligible for membership with the Credit Union and they accepted me with open arms.  I've been with them for eight years and I've never been dissatisfied.\n\nSometimes I do banking for other people and I have to go to one of the big banks and the lines are ridiculous.  At SSSCU if you go inside it takes about, oh, 3 minutes from the moment you walk in the door until you're out.  Everyone's always very friendly and helpful.  There's free coin cashing, this particular branch has always been pretty for a bank (they're remodeling right now) and....darn it, it just rocks.\n\nYou don't have to be employed by a Nevada school to be a member.  If you're related to a member of the bank, you can be a member.  Also, if you want to belong so badly, if you donate to Vegas PBS you are eligible for membership.  And you should donate to Vegas PBS cause...uh...I work there.",

    "text": "I have been with SSSCU for about 7 years. They were good to me over the years...until recently. I financed my car through SSSCU last year. My payment was about $170 per month, but after a couple of months my payment jumped to about $270. Apparently, they never received my proof of insurance (which I was never notified of), so they tacked on their own supplementary insurance. As soon as I found out I provided proof of insurance; I was told that my payment would remain at $270 for 8 more months. I filed paperwork to modify my loan (by modify I mean get the payment back to what I agreed to pay when I signed the paperwork). I was told that they couldn't modify the loan since I hadn't missed any payments...I will never understand how being responsible is a bad thing...\n\nThe icing on the cake is that I was told by a representative of SSSCU that I wouldn't be responsible for any loan payments until the paperwork had been reviewed and I was notified of the outcome. This was COMPLETELY FALSE. Not only did I miss my payment and get charged late fees, but they automatically took out the payment resulting in 5 overdraft fee equaling $150. When I contacted the bank to try and rectify the situation and get at least some of the overdraft fees reversed I was basically told that I was S.O.L.\n\nI don't know what happened, but at some point they just stopped caring about customer service (just like most companies nowadays). I have recently opened an account at another financial institution and will be transferring my loan ASAP.",

    "text": "This company is a joke.... I called them directly after seeing their Groupon, the owner told me not to buy the groupon and I made an appointment with him directly to have 1 Sofa cleaned on Wednesday of this past week.  The time I was given was 10am - 2pm but was told someone would call me the evening prior by 7pm to confirm a more specific time.  At 8pm when no one had called I had to call them and had to leave a message on the machine.  At 8:30pm someone called to confirm however not in response to my message.  I was then told it would be more like noon for my appt the following day but no later than 2pm.  The next morning the owner called at 8am to see if I heard from anyone....I told him I did and that I was scheduled for 12-2pm.  I was also told I would receive a call when they were on the way.  By 1:45pm with no call and no one showing up I called back, someone who clearly doesn't have any customer service skills answered the phone.... Didn't know when they would arrive, actually told me he couldn't get in touch with the tech because the tech wasn't returning his calls..... That reassuring!   After about 30 more minutes of waiting I was told that it would be more like another hour before they would arrive... That meant almost 4pm.  Unacceptable!!! Finally the owner called and wanted to \"make up\" for the mistake..... there was no mistake, the company is unprofessional period!!! However he insisted on coming to clean the sofa for free.... I will admit I did give in and agreed, we confirmed for an appointment today Saturday between 8am - 10am.  I am sure you won't be surprised to hear no one showed up, no call..... Nothing..... The owner did give me what he said was his personal cell phone so at 10:00am today when I called to see where they were.... Would it surprise you if I told you he didn't answer..... I followed up with another call, again now answer and then I sent 2 text messages... NO RESPONSE...... As I am typing this review my cell phone just rang, it was the technician letting me know he was on the way...... I said you were supposed to be here between 8-10..... He said no I have 8-12..... What a joke, I told him no thank you, I would rather pay twice as much and have it done professionally then deal with incompetent and unprofessional people.  Oh by the way when the tech called on Wednesday and said he was about an hour away and it would be more like 4pm I asked where he was currently, the distance to my condo from where he was was less then 20 minutes yet he told me it would be an hour....when I spoke to the  owner and he offered to do it for free today I had told him that the people he was sending on Wednesday were clearly not where they said they were or they would have been able to get to me sooner.... His reply..... I'm sending someone else on Saturday, I have issues with that tech and because of HIPPA laws I really say anything else.... Ok so clearly you know you have issues with this employee yet you are still sending him out as a representative of the company..... Clearly there are bigger issues then my couch and I will take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately you can't post without giving a star..... Gave 1 but certainly wouldn't have if I could have done it differently.",

The day of, the cleaners gave me the run around from an \"emergency,\" to we are on the way, to I just got a flat tire. Ok, so I was patient and the technician told me they would be back at 7:30 the following morning. My boyfriend planned to meet him and we only had an hour as he had to be at work. The technician never showed, nor answered any of his calls. I have contacted the owner and expect a follow up after the holiday weekend. This was a major inconvenience and horrible customer service...can't comment on the quality of the cleaning because it never happened!!

I will admit we had been looking for a cleaning service for a month so our house may have been a little worse for ware, which is why we gave them two chances. Where to start.\nFirst day power wash team, Rang our bell 6 times with questions as odd as how do we turn on water to where , with the last ring I told them if they couldn't complete the job with out further interruptions they could leave.When they did leave our gate was left wide open ( we have pets and they were told to watch the gate) our phone lines had been damaged by the power washing and had to be replaced.\n\nCleaners came No vacuums, no mops and no obvious cleaning products. All they did was wipe surfaces with a dry rag, they sprayed some solution on our marble floor which made it sticky. They did not vacuum the carpet, the stairs or the wood floor. There were crumbs on the counters and the area rugs had not been vacuumed\n\nLater that day Carpet Cleaners came and yes it was up sold 174.00 for stairs and deodorant. They asked me if my house had been cleaned as it was still not vacuumed and the kitchen was barely touched. I said yes your crew was here this morning, they called the owner and gave me a free house cleaning ( not really free as I had paid for a house cleaning I did not get ) He could not understand why they had no vacuum, mops or brooms. They cleaned the carpets and honestly they look worse, they were wet for a few days afterwards, He apologized again and they also gave me a free carpet cleaning to be used in the future ( not going to happen) .\n\nLast week I got the replacement house cleaning same results, crumbs on counters, sticky floors, it was obviously a quick run through the house. My laundry room was never even swept. All in all a nightmare. Called owner not event o cancel just to request a new cleaning team. He went off on me saying that it's me no one else has problems . Extremely Rude and unprofessional. I was not trying to get anything for free,  I just wanted what I paid for, 575.00 of cleaning that never really lived up tot he cost. Plus we had to pay Time Warner for Phone Wire repairs. Maybe it's us, perhaps we are pigs but I would think twice about this service if only for the owners attitude",

The receptionist looked for between 1-2 minutes and returned to her computer. Two other women entered the office, one to help, the other to tell us she would help, but she was too busy! I needed to get another money order because I had mistaken the amount I owed for my deposit and said I would be back.\n\nI returned 20 minutes later,  giving my money to the receptionist and I sat down, expecting them to continue looking, considering they opened ONE drawer and looked for such a short period before I left. After sitting down for 15 minutes and noticing that the receptionist had not left her computer, I asked, \"so... are you not looking for the keys anymore?\" And she told me to follow my realtor's instructions for using the lockbox until they sort things out and find my keys and gate opener.  I asked why she didn't bother searching anymore and her only reason was because they weren't in a particular drawer! You gotta be kidding me! Things get misplaced all the time, you don't see the need to check anywhere else???\n\nI have no problem using the lockbox and have already informed the gas company of the change to accommodate the situation, but feel that the receptionist should have not given up looking for my keys so quickly. This is my home we're talking about and this company is in the business of getting you into your home, you'd think they'd be more interested in helping their customer.",

I was moved into a unit for a decent price in a terrible neighborhood while watching them refinish and upgrade the units around me. In the first month that I had lived there, I had Janice and a plumber come into my unit, without my approval and get my floor covered in sh*t water. Literally. They used MY towel to clean up the mess when trying to fix my toilet...\n\nThey had a plumber go into my \"backyard\", which was just a run behind the unit, and snake the drain. It was covered in baby wipes from at least 6 months ago, according to the plumber. So, there were/are shty baby wipes right behind my unit that they don't care to clean up. I have a light in my unit that won't light up and I had told them about it, but they still haven't fixed it. I had a construction worker on my roof at 8 am without letting my know, whatsoever. I live next to a drug dealer, told them about it, and they took a blind eye because they just wanted their money and couldn't find any other tenants because they let the place go to hell. I saw pictures of how it looked before they bought it, and the units were actually nice and there were no weeds. Now there is a drug dealer with an annoying chihuahua running the place with their \"clients\" coming in and out all of the\n\nThey were bullies and I am so glad that the new company has recently taken over my property. I will definitely hold resentment towards Remax and Rick and Janice Cofield. They act like children, hang up on their tenants, and allow people into your unit without your approval. If you want to be bullied around in a place that YOU pay for, definitely use these guys. They rocked my socks -_-",

    "text": "I came to Las Vegas in March looking for a place for my husband and I to live. \nDebbie Bird {Real Estate agent} showed me the property at Bella Vista. When I first saw it I really liked it because the appliance matched. It was enough room for My husband and I and our 2 pets. \nI immediately got everything in motion so I could go back east and pack. I gave myself 3 days to find a place. I went into Remax Central on Sahara\nand met Tobie. Tobie went over the lease. I told her my husband and cat will come later has he was finishing up things back east. The rent was \n$699. I paid a pet deposit of $300 for my Pom among other fees. I told Tobie  my husband and cat will be here later on in the year. She said as soon as they get here we will have to pay another pet deposit for the cat. No problem. Tobie and I agreed on that. I left Las Vegas with the lease stating $699 a month. I signed a year lease. Gave money for a year lease. \nI signed the lease in March. I did not move in until May18.  \nIn the middle of April I get an email from someone name Laurine Huynh from Remax Central stating that I will have to pay for my cat before I get there. I wrote back and told her Tobie and I agreed that when my husband and cat get to Las Vegas just come into Remax and pay another pet deposit.\nLaurine Huynh Very Nasty person said Tobie is not a leasing agent she filled in for her because she was on pregnancy leave. I said well how was I suppose to know what position Tobie is and did not know who  Laurine is. I have never heard of you.\nFirst I thought it was a scam. So I wrote Tobie she said Laurine is the leasing manager. I talked to Laurine and told her Tobie and I had an agreement I signed a lease with Tobie not with you. I also stated to her so everything Tobie said was a lie? Her words were that's not what I am saying. I said yes it is because if it was not then why are you telling me something totally different from what tobie and i discussed in March and a lease i already signed.\nI left Las Vegas thinking the rent was $699.\nIt changed to I had to pay for my cat deposit right at that moment even though I did not know when my husband and cat would be here.  Another fee came up $50 extra a month for my husband and cat. I said for my husband and cat are you kidding me. She wrote back and said: \nBecause you are adding extra people. What?? extra people? How is my husband an extra person. This is a 2 bedroom 1 bath condo.On the application said will except pets 2 maximum. I had already agreed to pay a security deposit for my cat even though I did not know when they would be there. Then another total came up. She said I would have to pay extra $75 for an extra inspection. WHAT!!!??? The lease I signed with Tobie already said it was going to be inspection every 3 months. Which was no extra money to me. So I have to pay for extra inspection for what month? They were already going to inspect it every 3 months so basically she was trying to make me pay for inspection that was already in the lease.\nJOHN and RUTH AHLBRAND is the owner of that Remax on 8400 W Sahara so i received in my email something that wanted me to give them my automatic signature\nI never signed that. But i did sign for extra fee for $50 more a month for rent for as they sated: EXTRA PEOPLE. I could have said NO but that would have meant i would have to come back to Las Vegas and start over. Laurine even said i could pay the extra $50 for the whole year if i wanted to. I said NO. I will pay it monthly.\nThey already had a year worth of rent from me and now they were going to have $50 more a month for my husband and cat. They thought they was going to get that $75 for an extra inspection which i fought NOT to give. \nWhen i got here in May2014 the air condition was broke. I spent 3 hot days in that apartment. I have high blood pressure, heart failure and i am disabled. The microwave was filthy underneath. The refrigerator was not cold. They had to replace all of that. She talked about me paying for that old nasty microwave. But they realized it was old and nasty underneath the vent. I guess i was so relieved to get a place {I was only in town for 3 days} i really did not look underneath the microwave.\nDerek the repair man {extremely nice} had to replace the bulb in the stove. When he pulled the stove out OMG there was dog food, dirt, a dog toyand a lot of food crumbs. \nEverything was wrong got fixed or replaced but not without the attitude of Re/max.\nI never hung anything on the walls while we lived there. I did not want them try and nickle and dime us when we moved which was this year. Long year in that apartment. We hired Maria House Cleaning service to clean and that place looked cleaner after we left than before. The stove had so many marks on it i thought it was part of the stove being everything was old except of the cabinets. The cabinets were changed over in all the apartments when they changed to condos. \nBeware they will nickle and dime you.",

I was told I had 90 days until they added interest which seem like a long ways away until i moved to California and before I knew it my 90 days were coming up. I didn't know what to do because I wouldn't be able to get to Arizona in time, with my work schedule and all. Thankfully, they allowed a close friend of mine who still resides in AZ go in and extend it for me. Which was very nice of them because I know the restrictions when it comes to liability and ownership. A few weeks ago I decided it was time to pay my laptop and iPad off and get it back but I didn't know how I would do it. Chad and Javier (the managers there) worked with me on it and were willing to ship it to me as long as I had proof that I was the one who pawned it. I sent over my information and sent them a little extra money for the shipping cost and they sent it out! I received it yesterday, packaged with care and no harm done. I'm very thankful for their service and I would recommend this store to ANYONE. They also have pretty cool stuff in there. Check it out. Thanks Pawn 1t!",

More than 3 months ago on August 5, 2014, I placed an order with them from the Del Mar store to purchase 125 silver eagles.  As of today, 11-6-2014, I still have not received any of my coins.  I paid with a personal check.  The amount was a little under $3,000.  They of course cashed my check as soon as they received it.  As I said its been 3 months and not once have they sent me an e-mail addressing or explaining whats going on, as you would expect from a legitimate business.  I have made many calls and almost always get a guy that calls himself Richard.  Richard has told me that his business partner and majority owner stole a lot of money from the business and that my account was one of the affected and that he cant send me my coins or even return my money.  He says he has a plan to make good on all the affected accounts but that it will take up to 2 years.  I of course have no way of knowing if this story is true but I do know that Richard has lied to me on several occasions.  For the last month and a half he has told me on 4 occasions that he has \"just sent out in the mail\" a letter detailing his \"business plan\" to repay the order.  He keeps telling me he \"just sent it out\" but the funny thing is I never get it.  They have a very nice web site and advertise themselves as an \"international bullion distributor\".  But after my experience with them I would have to say that this operation is a scam.  Beware!    Andy",

After breakfast I emailed a quick photo from my phone to Gabe with a brief description, thinking this would be the beginning of a long process.  \n\nBy the time I got in my car to head off to work, I got immediate acknowledgement from Gabe, then his staff emailed me a well-organized email about what to expect and that a company was already \"in que\" to contact me for setting up an appointment to fix!!!  I was quite blown away, I don't think McDonald's could've processed quicker than that.  \n\nI was not hassled with a barrage of questions, I did not have to wait for response or put any effort into this claim process.  It was simply TAKEN CARE OF and THAT's what I call service!  :)    \n\n(FYI...I highly recommend the very cheap \"zero deductible\" window policy, the cost of replacing this one window is 3x the cost of the entire annual policy...I will pay nothing.)",

    "text": "The entire reason you have insurance is to protect you from losing the things you've worked so hard for in life. Unfortunately insurance is one of those industries that is built around agents and businesses with self serving interests.  We all hear the horror stories of people submitting claims and then fighting to get them paid. If you've ever been in this situation you know it can feel like a David and Goliath battle (because it is). It's a stressful and alienating process to say the least. \n\nGabe Paola and his team are true game changers. I have several properties and auto policies with the Paola team. I have also had to filed a number of claims. Never have I had a single issue. No complicated phone menus and no sitting on hold for hours. They are quick to respond, compassionate about your situation and most importantly stay on top of things until your claim is resolved.  \n\nGabe has a loyal customer base because he puts his customers first. He is honest, fair and follows through. We all have enough to worry about in life. I salute Gabe and his team for taking one of those major worries off my plate!\n\nIn my opinion, if you're even considering anyone else you're making a huge and potentially very costly mistake.",

We have a LOT of insurance policies with Gabe and we are constantly having to communicate with him and his staff for our always changing needs, business issues, etc.  \n\nHaving a busy contracting business, we often get requests to provide insurance coverage documents from multiple clients without any notice. One call or email and it's immediately taken care of.  We don't have to do a thing and his quick response maintains good relations with out clients.\n\nWe are required to carry large policies for business liability, workers comp, umbrella, etc. for millions of dollars.  It's critical we know our coverage and Gabe has thoroughly explained our policies, coverages, etc.  \n\nThe negative reviewer below in my opinion appears another example of an \"entitled\" person who has no accountability for reading what he/she is purchasing, did not ask questions and is writing out of anger.  When you purchase anything, it's nice to have it all explained to you, but ultimately it's your job to know what you're buying or it's your own dumb fault...even if you're a college grad.  \n\nPersonally, Gabe has a wonderful personality, sense of humor and a phenomenal family who tirelessly raises money for charity.  We love him!  Thank you Gabe (and Jeanie!) for everything!  You have made our lives much easier time and again.",

I was referred to Kevin Hiew through a friend who kept raving about him.  At the time, I was satisfied with my State Farm agent.  But 9 months after I got divorced, they seemed to be unable to update my new address, let alone split our account in two.  So I took that as a cue to seek insurance elsewhere, and since the Hiew Agency was so highly recommended, why not give them a try.  Let me tell you, Kevin, Sally, and Christine are just the most awesome and pleasant people you can ever expect to deal with.  You'll totally forget they're selling you insurance, and want to take them all out to dinner.  I really can't say enough about these guys, they totally ROCK.  I bug them frequently with questions, car changes(I have a real bad car shopping problem), and they never seem to get annoyed.  I know it's their job, but you know how pesky some customers can get, well that's me, and it never seems to  phase them.  So if you happen to be canvassing auto insurance, home owners insurance, life insurance, or anything insurance related, do yourself a favor and give these guys a try.  By the way, I posted their new address on top of this review.  I believe the address they have listed is their old one.  But the phone number is correct...",

I told her the wedding was about to start; she didn't care.  I ran to Kinkos, almost missed my friend's wedding and furnished the document so we could close on time.\n\nWe were unable to close the following week despite what she told me because their underwriter was unable to look at the documents I almost missed the wedding to furnish.  I had to reschedule movers at a time when it is difficult to find people in town and was stuck paying for a while for a house I couldn't live in.  \n\nThe broker then discussed with the Realtor that I was not complying and it was my fault the loan was not going to close on time.  She omitted to tell the realtor that she had only just sent the document to me a few days prior and that I had turned it around within an hour.\n\nNow that I've closed, I've received emails from the broker asking for documents I already sent her weeks ago and urgent requests for documentation or they are going to cancel my loan.  I've asked her for a list of the documents she will need in the future; she is refusing to provide them.  \n\nI can't speak to cars or banking, but I can say with respect to mortgages these people are very disrespectful of your time and the your presence in this process.  They don't seem to care that this goes smoothly and they don't manage your stress or concerns.\n\nI've talked with several of my colleagues at the University and they have said that their experiences with the Credit Union have been truly awful in other ways and they would never have a mortgage through them.\n\nAfter my experience, the specific criticisms they have made (disorganization, poor technology, poor customer service) seem to have happened in my case as well.\n\nI do not recommend.",

I wanted to sign the form that I did not receive electronically. The front desk personnel would not assist me as I did not have my driver's license on me. It really should not be this difficult. I am now searching for a new lender as there will not be a 4th attempt and I am not happy with the service I have (not) received....",

They denied a 1500 dollar claim on a technical issue of not reporting a new VIN of a new vehicle in 30 days. They investigate claims to deny coverage not to actually provide customer service but to not pay out. This is disgusting. So for a 1500 dollar claim that I would have paid a deductible of 500 and they 1000. This on a policy I pay 200 dollars a month for. The math is undeniable. An managerial  oversight of this issue would have shown what bad business this is. Now not am I only a business enemy who will bad mouth Progressive to whomever will listen but they have lost my 15 years of business patronage. So screw you Progressive and your Flo commercials.",

    "text": "I had a terrifying event with Progressive insurance.  A truck that was spewing rocks on the freeway caused roughly $1,200 damage to my car on the 215 in Las Vegas.  I was able to obtain the trucks license plate number through the onslaught of rocks.  I immediately called my insurance company who was able to identify who owned the vehicle.  After calling the company, I was informed that Progressive Insurance covered them.  Once I contacted their local office, I went through the standard protocol of getting an estimate and waiting on correspondence.  The claim representative assured me that she would contact me on a weekly basis.  However, this was not the case.  Every week I would have to reach and received the same answer, \"We are still investigating Legacy Rock.\"  Legacy Rock is a truck company that ships landscaping rocks out of Logandale, Nevada.  Despite my exact specifics that I explained to the claims adjuster, her reply after 44 days was, \"I'm sorry we are denying your claim because the insured said the truck was somewhere else.\"   The representative began to explain the scenario as if I were trying to scam progressive.  I asked her if there is an appeal process or if I may see any documentation to follow up on the claim.  She said there is nothing to do, but take it up with your insurance.  I have never been so livid and disappointed in a major corporation.  I provided a thorough and specific testimony explaining specific times, date, how rocks fell, where they fell, license plate, and even recorded for them.  This has been one of the longest and most grueling experiences I have endured.",

    "text": "I had progressive motorcycle insurance for two years as of writing this review, and canceled it today for very good reason. \n\nMy policy was paid a year in full effective august 2013 to August 2014 (Completely paid!) and I also sent the required documentation they mailed me about 2-3 weeks later to finalize the deal. So come March 2014 I receive a letter from the Nevada DMV stating that \"I am uninsured, provide proof of insurance or pay 250$ to reinstate your registration\". I instantly called Progressive and they searched the state database and informed me I had a 12$ outstanding bill because of a new law passed in Nevada for under insured/under covered motorists. I gladly paid the 12$ and asked that they please inform the NV DMV that I have had coverage from August 2013 paid in FULL! The representative said that she would, and at that point I was very happy. She also asked me if I wanted to pay for my policy renewal for August 2014 to August 2015, I said sure so I don't forget let's get that out of the way. So I paid for an additional year in full, thanked the rep for her time and went on my marry way. \n\nCome May 2014 I received another letter from the Nevada DMV, and stated if I do not provide proof of insurance from January 15th 2014 to March 15th  2014 that my license would be suspended, registration revoke, and could face possible fines up to and including jail time!? So I called Progressive and asked them WTF? Basically. I was informed according to their system connected to the NV DMV, that I did not have coverage from January 15th until March 15th 2014. I informed the rep that I paid in full effective August 2013 and I should be covered until August 2014, and I also paid my coverage until 2015! So I was kindly informed that because of the new law passed by Nevada - under insured motorist coverage needs to be offered, but not required. I informed the rep I never received anything in the mail, and in the event of a policy cancelation shouldn't I have received a phone call to remedy the situation! She said we are not required by state or federal law to call customers, just send them notifications in the mail! I then asked to speak to someone else, as she was becoming irate as if I was the one at fault here. \n\nSo I spoke to an under-writer and explained the situation. She said I have to pay any fines from Nevada of face jail time. At this point I was livid!!!!! I informed her that Progressive took my money to cover me for a year, a notice was supposedly sent to my house which I never received for a new Nevada state law. At that point Progressive dropped my coverage without so much as a phone call, and now I have to pay 500 dollars after you took 450$ to cover me for the year without at least a refund of that money!? And then took additional money for the next year clean to 2015!\nI then asked for a refund, and informed the women on the other line that I would be contacting the insurance commissioner and BBB and whatever other acronym agency I can call. Steer clear of these folks, the only reason I used them was because Esurance has motorcycle coverage through them. I have had Esurance for 10 years now, never had any issues like this crap. They call me to renew the policy every 6 months on my 4 cars, and make sure they are getting me the best price. I called my Esurance Rep and told him what happened; he said it happens to often with Progressive. I have a credit score of 760 and pay every bill I have ever had on time, and these morons take the cake that's for damn sure.",

    "text": "Where should I start?  I've got it:  Do not even consider Progressive for any insurance policy.  If you have already fallen victim to Flo's \"charm\"; cancel your policy immediately.\n\nThe abbreviated facts pertaining to my experience with this poor excuse for an insurance company are as follows:\n\nI suffered a not at fault loss on April 6 2013; my car is just now fixed and back in my hands on July 25 2013.  You must be thinking, \"wow this must have been some crazy accident!\"  Nope, a minor fender bender in the parking garage at my residence. Total damage was sub 5,000 dollars.  For those following along it took 3.5 months for my claim to be resolved and vehicle repaired.  The claims reps at this company are unprofessional and incompetent.\n\nIf you are unfortunate enough to be involved in a dual insured case, as I was, I whole heartedly feel pity for you. What's a dual insured case?  That's when both parties in an accident both have the same carrier.  What would normally be one company representing you and another the other party, with loyalty to their own insured, goes right out the window when you have Progressive AND a dual insured case.  Why?  Because the claims reps are clueless and work in concert with each other in the same office. Their sole goal in the claim process is to minimize their exposure while all along fucking over both parties.\n\nIf you like 7 day delay times between voicemails and emails, go with this company.  If you like voicemails and emails being totally ignored, go with this company.  If you like to have your car in the shop twice as long as it should be, go with this company. If you like your car sitting in the shop untouched because the field adjuster can't make it out not once, not twice, not three, not four, not five times!  Go with this company.  If you prefer to not be present when an adjuster makes a visit to the scene so they can discuss it without your presence and fuck you over even more, go with this company.  If you want to be bent over and fucked without lube, go with this company.\n\nBetter yet, choose any insurance carrier over Progressive.  Learn from my lesson, a low price on your policy equates to piss poor service when you need them to handle a claim; it's that simple.\n\nAnyone needing a full detailed account of my claim, feel free to message me for the details.  You've been warned.",

    "text": "Brought a relative, who has been a client here for over 14 years, to get something notarized last month and they apologized but said none of their employees were a Public Notary. When we expressed surprise that a bank did not have a notary, the guy said they had one but that employee left 3 weeks before. He suggested we visit another nearby branch so we did.   I wish  would have thought about asking him to call  before we left, because when we got there that branch (19th and Thunderbird)  also did not have an employee who was a Notary.  They called the branch on Hatcher for me to verify a Notary was available. So we drove to that third branch, the manager said the Notary was the teller who was working at the counter and, because she was the ONLY teller working behind the counter, she could not notarize for us (even if we stood in line to see her) but we could make an appointment to come back the following day to have the document notarized.  The employees encountered were all polite, but honestly 3 branch visits by a customer and not able to get a document notarized? What a fiasco.  Ironically, on the way home we stopped at a bank where she was not a customer and they cheerfully  notarized for her, for free, and it took 5 minutes.  She was so impressed she is transferring her accounts from B of A to this other bank (Chase).\n\nWhile helping with the transferring process, I called B of A branch several times to ask a question yesterday and always got a recording that said \"all agents were busy\" and referred me to their website (which I already had looked at but  it did not answer my question).  I am getting the same recording again all this morning, so I guess we will end up having to drive up there.  Very frustrating for a bank customer to not be able to call their branch and get help or information.",

I went in to make a deposit to another person's account, and not having an account myself, I was forced to use some strange ATM in the lobby that had someone in Delaware on a screen trying to assist me. I put my large sum of money into the deposit slot, as directed, and after several seconds, one bill popped back out. A person in the bank came over and had a private conversation on a phone attachment with the person in Delaware and several minutes later she told me to go deposit the money that had come back out of the machine with the teller, who was an actual live person. This was about 25 minutes after I arrived at the bank to make a 5 minute transaction. I went in search of the lady who sent me to the teller and ended up spending an additional 45 minutes in an office while she punched numbers into a phone (apparently she doesn't rate talking to a live person either). Turns out the person who has the account I was attempting to make the deposit into has to file a dispute with the bank to find out where the money is. They flatly refused to give me any sort of receipt or acknowledgement that my cash was in their broken machine. I was sent on my way with a post-it note with the transaction number hand-written on it, the knowledge that the account holder is now burdened with filing a dispute, and an apology. I put over $1000 in their machine and left the building OVER AN HOUR LATER with NO RECEIPT and NO MONEY. \n\nTo sum up, if you don't bank here, they won't do you the courtesy of speaking with you unless something goes wrong with their machines. A malfunction that is their fault WILL become your responsibility and your problem in that they will require YOU to dispute their practices, and you WILL leave the building WITHOUT A SHRED OF PROOF THAT YOU GAVE THEM ANY MONEY.",

Normally it wouldn't be a big deal, but when I got here my customary 5-10 minutes early, I just so happened to sit next to the guy ahead of me, whose appointment was at 2:00. That's about 55 minutes late for those trying to keep up with all the numbers.\n\nA few minutes ago, roughly 3:05, I was acknowledged and told she was running \"a little behind.\" The acknowledgement was appreciated and saved a 2-star rating.  Knowing he was an hour past his appointment, I asked for a guess at how long it would be, to which I was assured \"about 30 minutes.\"   He was finally called back shortly after that, and I continue to wait.\n\nI've been with Bank of America for somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years or more.  I like the bank, and the people at this location and most of the ones I dealt with in Florida are friendly.  However, I can't help but feel it's not too much to ask for a simple phone call to let someone know when you're running 30-60 minutes behind. \n\nWhile the company as a whole I would rate 4 stars, this branch doesn't quite make that level, and hence the 3-star rating.  Before you think me to picky based on a single experience, I'd like to note I've been irritated here before.  In addition to the time issues I experienced today, I've also found certain others at this location to be a little pushy when it comes to Bank offered services (credit cards, retirement plans, etc). I realize this is probably a system thing and not a location thing, but it hasn't been like this at other branches.\n\nI'm finishing this up, now the 30 minutes later I was told, and eagerly await my turn so I can finish up and enjoy the rest of my day off. Fortunately they seems to be wrapping up.  I may update further at a later time pending the outcome here.",

I get in his office and he's blasting his music. I love rap as much as the next person but after telling him about my father he continues to let his music play which is offensive (cussing) and loud. I told him I needed an estate account per my lawyer. He instead tries to talk me into having a check sent to me for the balance. I told him again I needed an estate account. During my time there he was cussing and making in appropriate comments. He said I wouldn't have access to the money until Monday (The date I was there was a Friday) because a person can't open and close an account the same day. This is not what I was told at another branch but I didn't argue. I asked to set an appointment for Monday. He instead insisted that I text his \"personal cell phone\". Monday comes and I text him around 430p AND call him (he didn't answer so I left a VM)as I was busy all day and he texts back at 4:57pm and tells me it's too late they close at 5pm. I'm pretty upset at this point. I tell him via text since he wouldn't return my call that I would have preferred to set an appt. He said \"that's why I was setting the expectation that I will work around you\". I ask if he can please set an appt for me for Tuesday and that I'd prefer to work with someone else. He ignores my request and continues to text me that this is my fault I wasn't able to come in. I tell him I want to speak with a manager and would like his managers name he texts back (Nope sorry can't do that). He finally calls me (it's going on 520-530 now) and finally sets an appt for the following day. My mom and I come in the next day (I didn't feel comfortable going alone), he is extremely rude. I was trying to use his pen and it fell apart when I took the cap off I said \"oh no your pen broke\" he replied \"or maybe you broke it\" in a ridiculously condescending tone. Then as I'm looking at some of the paperwork he snatches it away from me and walks out of the office without saying a word. When he comes back I ask him for the numbers that were on the paperwork. He let out a big sigh and said \"fine I'll have to pull up your account\" as if I was inconveniencing him. Then I ask to pull out some money and he says I'll have to wait in line for a teller. I told him that was fine. The amount I wanted was over 7k. A coworker overheard us talking and said I could only take out 7k but that they could order us the full amount and it would be there by the end of the week. I declined. I asked if 7k was the daily limit. She said yes unless I use a special ATM as that would allow 10k but I didn't have a debit card since the account was brand new. Fast forward a day, I decide to go to a different branch to pull out money. They tell me that there is no daily limit if you're at a branch and I was able to take out well over 7k. The customer service there is terrible. I feel like David should have let me work with someone else, if I wasn't just trying to be done with this mess I would have made a bigger deal at the branch when I was there but with the way he was acting I don't think that would have gotten me anywhere.",

    "text": "I needed a backup, for emergencies only sort of account, somewhere I could put money and forget about it until the day rolled around I needed it. It was a mistake getting it from BOA. \nI need to take some of the blame though, I am the one who opened a BOA account and didn't realize I needed to have paperless billing or I would be charged $9 A MONTH. After many months have passed I finally checked my statement to realize I didn't have enough in savings (the majority was all in checking) which charged me an additional $5, so for months I have been being charged $14. \nI'm willing to take responsibility for that. But, I do think it's pretty crappy to charge someone that much a month in fees!\n\nI stopped in this branch yesterday to close the account and was surprised how little they seemed to care. We exchanged greetings and chatted about our Halloween and what each of us were doing. I told him I needed to close both my savings and checking account, he said OK and printed off the paperwork no questions asked. Really? No Questions? This bothered me more than the fees, he never asked me why I'm closing the account, never asked if there was anything he could do to keep me a member, seemed pretty happy to let me go. I've heard this from other people, BOA just doesn't care about their members. If he would have asked why I was leaving and asked to look at my account to see how we could eliminate fees from that point forward I may have considered staying a member, but to no avail, he just didn't care.",

    "text": "I hate this branch more than words can express and I try hard to never need to use it.\n\nDespite having 8 fully equipped teller stations clearly visible, they NEVER, EVER, EVER have more than 2 tellers even at peak rush times.  They have managers walking around or literally standing by the door to \"welcome\" you as you wait, but they don't get behind the counter and actually help.  They can talk to you in multiple languages, but they won't actually help get your banking handled so you can get on with your day. \n\nThen as you stand in the forced long line, you get to listen to very loud random beeping sounds as other people use the indoor atm machine also located inside the branch near the tellers.  Nice.  That's pleasant and relaxing.  As I stand there getting more irritated by the minute all I can think is if B of A would stop spending so much money on televisions running their own commercials and multiple cameras and teller stations that aren't utilized then they could maybe afford to pay more tellers so their customers could actually get banking done in a reasonable amount of time.  This branch so clearly displays the glut of waste and poorly thought out business plans within B of A. \n\nAs you wait you'll also see elderly people struggle to move quickly in the parking lot full of racing cars madly hunting for one of the VERY few parking spaces.  Then you watch them get tired or be in pain as they stand and wait to be helped because there's nothing for them to sit or even lean on as they wait.  It's painful to watch old people struggle like this.  It's so very clear that B of A doesn't give a da#n about old people or anyone with mobility issues for that matter.  Why must you close the drive thru lanes that would really help these older people??  I REFUSE to use any part of B of A for my own business purposes and if I weren't employed by a man that uses B of A I'd never set foot into another branch.  \n\nOh yeah, that's another fun piece of being forced to deal with B of A, if you're not an actual customer of theirs, you don't even have a way to complain!  There is no way to even contact their customer service unless you have an active account number...  WOW!  Talk about blatantly not caring what your neighborhood or community have to say about you!  Hence why I'm yelping today, because it's the only way I can warn others to not use this branch unless you have nothing else to do with your day or your time and you don't mind watching elderly people struggle.  \n\nSad, pathetic business practices... B of A, you should be ashamed of yourself!",

After starting a joint account with my fianc\u00e9, we waited over a month only for the cards to never show up in the mail. We called multiple times during this month and the TruWest employees told us multiple lies. The first time we called, we were told that the cards were sent out on the 8th of October. The second time we called, we were told that they hadn't been sent out until the 20th of October, keep in mind this was already on the 30th of October and we still did not have the cards for our accounts which were opened at the end of September. Finally, they lost 20$ on our account and almost lost all 75$ since it took them almost the whole month to transfer our deposit. We had to file a claim against them with Bank of America in order get our money back. If you like a bank that will fail to get your credit cards delivered within a whole month and lie to you about it multiple times, then TruWest is the bank for you! Also, after telling multiple employees about everything that happened to us NOBODY offered us anything to make up for the situation. Since TruWest doesn't want to offer me anything, I will offer them this bad review so that potential future customers can see the way that they treat their current customers. After a month of being lied to and still not receiving our cards we went in to a Chandler branch to pull out all of our money and we will be canceling our accounts soon. I would not trust this bank with a single penny as they have proven countless times that they are not trustworthy.",

We turned the Mazda 6 in to the dealership on September 11, 2012 which was the end of the lease.  The car had its inspection well ahead of time, and nothing was mentioned about mileage.  We knew we had some body damage.  When we turned the car in, we got some negative comments from Sergio Brooks about not releasing a Kia.  Again nothing was mentioned about mileage.  He also said nothing about fees owed. He just took the keys and said we could go like we were a big aggravation to him.  On December 13, 2012 we received a surprise bill from Chase Auto Finances for not only turning in the car, but going over the mileage.  Wow nothing like receiving a bill 3 months late when it was supposed to come 4-5 weeks after turning in the car.  The bill included a fee for mileage overage which no one mentioned.  In speaking again to Sergio Brooks, he said that we had signed for 10,000 miles.  Really?  At the time, we had negotiated for 12,000 miles which they conveniently forgot to change.  Also they let us continue to drive the car with no advance notice about mileage overage. He was condescending reminding us that if we had leased again, all those charges would go away.  He also reminded us that they lost money on the deal.  I guess they will be recouping that with the mileage overage fees that we got charged.\nSO BEWARE WHEN YOU LEASE OR BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.",

We started communicating with their internet sales person Steve and he was very prompt on getting back to us. Yesterday, while we were out we received a reply from Steve and decided to go check out some cars at Courtesy Imports. We were greeted as soon as we walked up and immediately directed to Steve when we asked for him. Steve was WONDERFUL! He was very pleasant and personable and showed us a few vehicle options within our price range. We test drove a couple vehicles, one pre-owned and the other a new 2014. He went over the difference in pricing, as well as the pro's and con's of purchasing each car. What I loved most about us going to Courtesy Kia was that they didn't BS us around. We tried to purchase this same car from Findlay Kia, whom we have done so much business with in the past, and whom we had referred so many people to and they tried to low ball us on our motorcycle trade in. At Courtesy Kia they gave us what we considered fair for our trade in and made sure to work with our budget. When they came back with the final offer the payments on the car were literally like 5 dollars off what we told them we wanted. All of their staff was very pleasant and nice and made us feel very comfortable. There was not a lot of negotiation that needed to be done and the whole process was pretty painless. Within a few hours we walked out happy customers with a new car! I will definitely be recommending my friends to them!",

The second time on 8/20 I had a crack in my windshield from a chip that had gone unnoticed.  Peter, the gentleman working the service desk, was INCREDIBLY helpful and resourceful.  He answered all of my ignorant questions (I'll be the first to admit I don't know much about cars and their inner workings) and even called Safelite for me to get a quote for windshield replacement (instead of trying to sell me on getting the factory original which would have been around $800).  When I called Safelite to set up an appointment, the guy told me that Peter had gotten me a really good deal on a dealership quote as opposed to what I would have had to pay if I had just called myself.\n\nI was very pleased, as it seems Peter had gone above and beyond to help me get my windshield replaced.  If you need to get service done, Peter is the guy to talk to.  I believe both times I went was on a weekday during normal business hours and I understand that's not possible for everyone, but if you can swing it, he's the best customer service at a service garage I've ever had!",

    "text": "Dealing with this car dealership has been one of the worst experiences I've had in my 12 years of business transactions.\n\nI inquired about a lease of a Mitsubishi electric car because of an article I read online which suggested getting an electric car would end up costing $60+ a month due to a $7500 credit from the government for getting an electric car.\n\nI spoke to the General Manager and he told me that the 24-month lease program with Mitsubishi would qualify for me to get a $7500 cah back.  He explained to me that I don't get the $7,500 right away but that I file a form and I get $7,500 within 90 days from the government. I then continued with the process of submitting an application.  Not only did I get stalled for several days but I had to continuously make phone calls in order to get an answer. Then the salesman tries to sell me another type of vehicle whil we were going through the process... wtf?! Finally they tell me that I had to redo the application inorder to qualify for the $7500.  You would think that since they only sold 7 of these vehicles over the last year and had 4 left would encourage them to make the deal happen... The way they dealt with me as if the business I was giving them was a favor to me and the unprofessionalism made me question if the information they told me was true.  Too good to be true right? \n\nSo I did more reseach online and contacted a nearby dealership to confirm the information Courtesy Imports gave me and found out it was completely incorrect!!  Not only was the $7500 a tax credit and not a refund, it is also not applicable to leases because the IRS guideline for the tax credit is only if you purchase an electric vehicle.  The leasing company gets the tax credit, not the lessee.  I called Courtesy Imports back to get their feedback on the information I had. Two of my calls got disconnected and when I called again, I was told they were \"in a meeting.\" \n\nNo wonder car dealerships and car salesmen have the worst reputation! But Courtesy Imports is by far the worst of them all.",

We were told not going to make a 2015 model so if we wanted one it would have to be what they had. Of course that was a lie. (We saw a commercial advertising 2015 models).  Didn't matter because we were also interested in a Kia Soul. After driving both we decided on a soul and went in to make a deal. We told them we were going to pay cash.  They still wanted us to fill out a credit application just in case!  Why. I have cash.  Went into finance guy he again tried to get us to fill out a credit app. I said no and we decided to go somewhere else as we were walking out some Guido Jersey Shore wannabe shouted across the showroom floor for everyone to hear that we probably didn't have the money anyway and probably had bad credit! Very poor way to treat customer especially one who wants to do a cash deal.  We ended up at team ford the next day and within 1 hour my daughter was driving a brand new Ford Focus.  Salesman said he loved cash deals and didn't know why courtesy would require a credit application on a cash deal!  Steer clear of this place. Something shady going on here and The Jersey Shore Guido is a real meatball!",

Went in knowing what kind of car we wanted, we found the car we liked, great!...Not so fast.......\n\nCourtesy Imports \"approved\" my credit....this \"approval\" was all part of a SCAM! We signed the financial agreement which stated that I was \"approved\". Steve Corbin, the salesmen calls about a week and a half later, telling me they couldn't get financing, so I would need to find a co-signer!! I asked him how that could be, because we had signed the financial agreement stating that I was APPROVED....he said he would have Rob, the finance guy call to explain .......2 weeks went by without any phone call from Steve or Rob. Then Steve calls again, saying they still can't get the financing \"done\" so I need to bring the car back! Um What? I say again, how can this be? and asked him to explain.....he tells me again that \"Rob\" will call me with more info. Well \"Rob\" NEVER called. Today, we took the car down there to give it back and for some reason the \"financial\" guy was STILL not available to speak with us.....they said all they needed from us was the keys to the car. Fine... I was done with their run around scam! \n\nOne other thing I thought I would include as well......\n\nThey had agreed to install xm radio...they would pay....We go to sign paperwork, and they added it into the cost of the car! We finally came to an agreement that we would pay for half. fine *rolls eyes* whatever! We pick up the car, and the \"factory\" install, looked like awful, it was not the nice factory install we were promised. They also put a huge crack in the side panel of the car while installing it. They said that the factory install we were looking for (meaning no wires and extra junk running out the back of the car) was not possible. My husbands was so annoyed with the xm install issues he asked if we could just give the car back and they said NO, THE SALE WAS DONE AND FINAL, THEY COULD NOT TAKE THE CAR BACK....HMMMMM, then why did I they call weeks later asking for the car back. We gave the car back.....not worth our time.",

I've met a lot of car salesman and by he was the knew so much about not only Mazda's products but other companies as well. Sure enough he was able to convince us to buy him the new Mazda Moto 6 2014.

The sales experience was difficult at best and took 5 hours.  I paid cash for the car and it still took 5 hours.  \n\nWhen I was given the key to the car, the sales rep stated there was no secondary key - valet key and promised to find or get a new key for me.  This never occurred.  I made multiple calls and at every service tried to get the key, but no one would get me a key.  They called me a liar and that I had lost the key and was just trying to get a new one.  This is not true as upon purchase of the car there was no key.  A year and half later, nothing!\n\nI have since sent a letter of complaint to Kia Motors Headquarters Orange County.  They state that they have nothing to do with any dealership and are a completely separate entity, however they did call the dealership and between two customer relations persons, Amy & Jason, neither could make the dealership obtain a key.   Upon the last call from Jason he stated the dealership told him, I, the customer, waited to long to obtain the key.  I told Jason this is a blatant lie and that I'd been trying to obtain the key since day one.   I went on to state that the last year and a half dealing with this issue had caused me emotional and physical distress.  He laughed at me.  I told him it wasn't funny.  He said there was nothing he could do.\n\nFunny how a mutli-billion dollar company cannot obtain a $5 valet key for it's customer, BUT THAT KEY WILL COST ME $150.  Amazing how both the dealership and Kia Headquarters can belittle the customer, call him a liar and resolve absolutely nothing and remain in business.\n\nMy advice is to stay away from Kia Motors as a whole.  The headquarters will not stand behind it's cars or dealerships as they are a complete separate entity.",

They told me the price I negotiated on the V6 was so close to the MSRP of the 4 cyl they gave me that they didn't have to give me a penny.

I would recommend to ask for Mike directly when planning a trip to courtesy imports. Very knowledgable, friendly and completely opposite from the typical car salesman you expect to be selling cars. He knows it is a big purchase and makes sure all the finer details are covered.  He introduced us to his manager Louis which made us feel even more special showing that they truly care about the experience and the service. Everything about this experience was exceptional as they did everything right. Thank you we will definitely be in for our next vehicle and all future servicing. \n\nAlissa",

    "text": "About a week and a half ago 6/7, I embarked on a trip from southern California to the east coast with my mother.  I had recently gotten my air conditioning fixed in my Mazda 3 for the occasion knowing that we'd be driving through several deserts. Leaving without that fixed is just dangerous, right?!\n\nWell, it had been working well for a couple days but, by the time we were on the outskirts of Las Vegas it started to blow 117 degree air at us. I heard one person say that it was the hottest day of the year so far. I called my mazda dealer from socal and they said to bring it to a dealer out there to keep the warranty on the new parts.\n\n SO! I came upon COURTESY Mazda in Henderson. I walked in and told them my story (1:00pm I'm guessing) by this point my temperature gauge was reading 119 degrees. They flat out said No, and that they would not be able to get to it till Monday (6/10).  Trying to go anywhere else would have been dangerous at temps like that and the closest dealer CENTENNIAL mazda said the same thing. I even considered driving at night but, that wouldn't have been safe either. That would have forced me to stay in Vegas over the weekend with no air conditioning and probably paying for an expensive hotel.\n\nLuckily, there is a good person there. The woman at the service desk was very helpful in finding us a great shop. They fixed it that day in a matter of hours while, having to order the parts too. He tried to get the parts from COURTESY and they turned out to cost $900 alone. For the parts and labor I payed $700.\n\n!!!BEWARE OF THESE SWINES!!!\n\nYou people give American business a bad name.\nYou should be receiving a package of elephant poop (1 Gallon) from poopsenders any day now, think of it as a metaphor for your shitty service...  \n\nYours truly,\n\nYour very own anti-customer.",

    "text": "Was coming here to leave my own review of the service department not knowing what others have said about their experiences. After reading their reviews I must say that I am shocked that Kia (Hyundai), Mitsubishi or Mazda would allow this to happen at a dealership and represent their brands. \n\nEvery time we brought our Kia in for service we also had similar issues arise. They would try to sell us things that we did not need. They were also not very easy going or polite. The final straw (and the reason we did not lease another Kia) came on our last oil change last month. My wife drove her car out of the bay and heard a strange clunking sound. She made it to the end of their property and got out to see what it was, she found a giant screw sticking out of her tire. She returns to the bay and the service manager looks at it and say's she must have ran over a screw and then tries to sell her a new tire. Furious that this happened on their watch in their garage she protests and the service manager agrees to pull the screw and fix it at no cost. Only after she got frustrated. \n\nHad no issues with the sales department and we got a great deal on the car when we purchased it. Think that they need to overhaul the service department experience and take them off any sales quotas or commission structures they might be working off. Too bad as Kia makes some good and cheap vehicles but it was not worth it to us. Too much competition and great deals to be had.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: all people who lease from KIA should expect to get hit with a BS $400 \"Disposition Fee\" when they turn in their lease. Handed back a mint condition Sorento and was told we were good to go. This bill arrived weeks later charging us $400. KIA claims they charge it to \"take your vehicle back\" and put into inventory. Yes, they charge you to accept their own property back. They would waive it if we bought a new KIA only (extortion). This item is sneaked in when you sign your lease agreement. Was never explained to us. BS charge. Be aware of it.",

I asked the bank manager to look up my address on their computer and saw with my own eyes that it was correct, so was the address on my Drivers license that they had a picture of on their computer, but that didn't stop them from charging me anyways.. then I asked why if I have an e account are you sending me mail anyway its an e account doesn't that mean email only, and I've signed up for paperless billing.. she said yes..im going to have to research that... I said no close my account I'm sick of these bogus charges.. Then they charged me 10 bucks for closing the account because of the unwarranted charges...

Their biggest problem in the area of Business Banking  is they have kids as \"business bankers.\" Every time I have to have something done I get an 18 year old that I have to explain to them how it was done the last time I had it done.

I was  really impressed with my experience with June. \nAfter she explained the policies and worked with her managers to find a solution.

    "text": "Yelp needs a zero star option! I rented a house with their warranty. The AC quit working when it was 110 out and they would only come mon-fri 8-5 and I can't miss work, so after a few days and talking my 75 year old dad into staying at my house to wait for them we had an appointment. They came and started to replace the fan motor outside, once my father saw their tech struggle with it and damage the fan blades he started to help. Once the guy was done he said it was good and left. I checked on it after work and the whole unit vibrated bad, must be normal if their tech left it like that. So two months later I came home to a hot house and the unit outside making an insane noise, I noticed the blade for the fan had came loose from collar that is mounted to the motor shaft and the motor was just spinning without the fan blade moving. I knew making an appointment would be a mess so I welded the blade to the collar since they were both trash and replaced as one piece and still made an appointment so it could be corrected in a more permanent way. A few days later a tech showed up and told my friend that I asked to be there for them that there was nothing wrong and it looked good. I almost had to argue with him about what it needed and once he realized he said ok and would order a fan blade and left. The next day I was told I need to pay $300 to have the blade replaced because I welded it. Seems obvious from all their reviews this place is quite the scam and try's to snake out of any repairs but more than happy to fix it for an extra charge. Save your money, it'd be cheaper to pay a competent company to just repair it right the first time",

The microwave needed to be replaced so I was told that they would pay $250 for a new unit but they do not pay for instal.  \nNext call was for the outlets in the kitchen.  The GFCI was popping for no reason.  Nothing plugged in and sometimes not even in the room.  The electrician that came out was great, super helpful and friendly.  After the one outlet was replaced all of the other GFCI's started popping.  So I called back and explained the issue.  The electrician was sent back out.  I was told that since it was a different circuit that I would have to pay $60 again.  I called to get more info about why i was going to be charged again.  After a long unpleasant conversation I asked the lady if she knew what all of her circuits did and was told \"No, but I'm not the one have electrical problems\".\nI feel like they are just after money and do not care about customer service.

I called Platinum and they immediately had their tech call. The tech was kind, but initially when I talked to him, he didn't seem to want to come out to the house. He asked me if I could wait a few hours to see if the A/C would start working again. I  didn't want to risk having no A/C overnight, so I insisted that he come out and he complied. The tech was at my house 20 minutes later, and after getting up on the attic he determined the cause of the problem to be the compressor motor, which he was able to replace immediately. I paid $120 for the weekend service call (business days are $60), but it was worth it to get my A/C working again.\n\nSecond, about a week later, my kitchen sink was backing up. So I called and scheduled an appointment for the next day. The tech showed up early (same guy from a week earlier, actually) and he snaked the sewer drain pipe and cleared the blockage.

If the freon is lost in the repair why would I need to pay an additional $150 and then if I want the part in a timely manor I need to pay $25-60 dollars extra.  You be the judge",

    "text": "Read the other 1 star reviews for Platinum Home Warranty and that pretty much sums up what I have to say about them. I have been with them for 1.5 years. No problems and great repairmen. I have PHW's Platinum service for my condo as I had older appliances and an older A/C when I bought my condo 1.5 years ago and I wanted to be able to have them replaced when the time came.  The time has come. My A/C, having had 7 service calls since I joined PHW, finally gave it up. Will they replace it like they say they will? NOPE!\n\nThe story: My A/C is too old and the sun has faded the serial number, so they can't tell what it is and can't order/get the cooling coil it needs. Per their fine print:\n1.) Section D under Limitations of Liability, Item 6E., \"Platinum is not liable for the replacement of the \"complete\" system or appliance due to the non-availability of one or more of its parts or incomplete or missing model numbers\".\n\nIf the appliance is old and the parts no longer exist, it will not be replaced - especially if the serial/model number has faded from sun exposure or age, which is an act of God, and therefore, is not covered. Bottom line, they will keep repairing an appliance until it is too old; therefore making certain they are not bound to replace that item.\n\n2.) Section F under Covered Systems and Appliances, Item 12 for Heating, A/C, Heat Pump, and Evaporative System, under \"Not Covered\", \"Platinum is not liable for complete system replacement in the event of a non-repairable leak\"\n\nMy A/C cooling coil has a leak and Freon has to be added all of the time. As the model is quite old, getting the appropriate coil will not happen. Therefore, Platinum does not have to replace my A/C.\n\nI have spoke to two people today in Claims and Service at PHW about replacing my A/C. I received an estimate of \"this GREAT deal\" (NOT!!!) for a Heil 3 ton heat pump at their wholesale price of $6837.35 and they will give me a $1500 discount and expect me to pay them $4837.35 + $60 service fee. Heil is not that good and when I researched this on the internet, I found a company that would sell me this same heat pump for under $3000 total cost incl. installation, etc.  I am currently trying to obtain quotes from other companies. I did speak with one company and received a quote for a better quality Bryant 3 ton heat pump for a total cost of $4200, which is $637 less than what Platinum wants to charge me for an inferior product. When I told the second person I spoke to at PHW, she got upset and tried to tell me that they were giving me a great price for a quality unit that is superior to the Bryant as one of their managers is having a Heil installed in her home and she only wants the best. If you look at the consumer ratings, Heil is close to the bottom of quality brands for heat pumps. My response to her was, \"If your manager decides to jump off a bridge, we should all jump off a bridge because your manager has such a good idea?\"  DUH!!! C'mon, Platinum! You all got a deal on some Heil's and your manager is probably getting this unit for free or at least a very low price making it worth her while.  Then, you pass on her savings to my fee!  No thank you!\n\nThink twice before choosing PHW.  Read the fine print first.  I wish I had.",

So i take my hits with a grain of salt with these places (and not yelp about it). But this place's incompetency took the cake.\n\nIm military living outside of PA. Made calls to AAA and asked if i could renew my PA license on the spot - was told i could. So i drove 6 hours there on a weekend to renew. Upon arriving i got three different stories from three different AAA people (all adamant on their stance of how to renew). It ended with the last person telling me I couldnt do it (had to wait 10 days for a camera card first before renewing - which I couldnt do). The confusion wouldnt have been that much of a gripe to yelp about - but the 'matter of fact' language used with all the conflicting opinions of a non existent policy was the nail in the yelp coffin for them. Having a 12 hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well.",

Do I park on the street, do I pull in that lot that has all the confusing signs?  Take your pick it doesn't really matter.  Careful crossing the streets to get here.  \n\nOnce inside, the confusion continues.  Signs are somewhat lacking and really don't directly tell you where you need to go.  Getting lost is easy in here.  Majority of the time, escalators are down for maitenence, making it that much harder to navigate the building.\n\nMy soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken.  At usual locations for the DMV, you walk in, take a number and sit and wait.  Not here.  Without a sign to indicate that you need to stop at the reception desk until you make it to the DMV portion of the floor, you have to turn around and wait in a line.  And when you wait, you get to hear the receptionist make a snarky remark about how you can't read a sign...MAKE IT BIGGER AND PUT IT WHERE A PERSON, not a dog, CAN SEE IT.\n\nThank god that all I had to do was get a picture taken while in here, or I might have lost it.\n\nSidenote: Is it just me, or would this place have been better used if it was a market to buy fresh meats and produce in.

I routinely wait for about an hour. Seems ridiculous? It used to piss me off but now I bring a magazine. \nIt is better to have a AAA membership when you go here because you will get a discount, but it is the only DMV in the area. It is convenient because of that, and they do validate parking.\nI recently bought an SUV out of state. The transfer could not have been easier, even with the messed up mileage written down by the idiot I bought it from. Can you believe he actually tried to sell me the truck with a Bill of Sale?? Yeah, um NO! (I'm just justifying calling him an idiot).\nYou can get pretty much everything done here, even get your license renewed. Do not go here on the weekend. It is a zoo. And don't go here during lunch hours during the week. Around 2 in the afternoon on a weekday has done me well. \nJust be patient and treat the employees with respect, and you will get out of here in one piece and maybe even in a good mood!",

She said nothing and that you can get up to 4 cards on one account and give them to anyone.

She told me about companion cards, which apparently can be given to anyone, but only if they come with you to the office. She tried to be helpful by offering a suggestion to visit my bank, but she should have been able to give me the companion card for my husband to use in the Bahamas.

After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) \n\nI recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  (a Dodge Ram is a truck... in case you didn't know... cause they didn't) This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.\n\nFor my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!\n\nWhy did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!\n\nOh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!\n\nIt has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.\n\nOh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).  If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling.  It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers.",

I'm not even sure if these friends were even telling the truth LOL but when I go in they request all kinds of paperwork on my father, who recently passed away, paperwork which is extremely time consuming and costly. And if I get that paperwork the bonus cash is off the table as well. Needless to say I went with a competitor. It still stings because I had heard many good things about Navy Federal and the credit union I went with has been unsatisfactory.\n\nPS - The older woman receptionist/greeter/front desk person is pretty rude and isn't the least bit helpful.",

I have a personal account and a business account here, and my adult kids have also opened accounts at this branch as well.\n\nThe two drive-thru ATMs are convenient, and there is rarely a wait of more than one or two cars. The same could be said for the single walk-up machine outside. There is ample parking, and the location is a convenient stop as I head down Horizon Ridge to head into town.\n\nInside, I have found the tellers to be well-trained and exceedingly friendly. Although dozens of tellers have come and gone over the years, the same friendly demeanor at the counter has been a constant.\n\nMy single complaint about this branch is it often seems understaffed with tellers at the busiest times of the day. Some of the longer waits there have seemed excessive, and I've never experienced such delays across the street at Wells Fargo.\n\nThat single complaint aside, I have generally positive feelings about this particular B of A location, primarily due to its prime location and friendly staff.",

You can also get help planning your trip (including cruises and just about anything else you might want to go on), and even score some luggage while you are there.  I think I have probably only used their actual roadside services once in all these years, so otherwise I am not sure that they are worth it.  Discounts on insurance?  I tried, but it did not work for me, though it may for you.\n\nBut for a relatively low cost each year, you can load up on almost all the maps and touristy information you can carry, all for no additional cost beyond that initial yearly investment, and even better is that a decent number of places (hotels, restaurants and even tourist attractions) offer discounts to card holders.  Naturally, if you do not travel much, it may not really be worth it.\n\nAs to the location, it is nice enough, but if you do not visit, that does not matter.  It is a bit of a challenge to find if you are not familiar - the \"approach road\" is \"executive circle\" (in fact, the insurance is now on the circle, not the main building).  Then there is a little offshoot that takes you to the main office, which is on \"aaa drive\".  So both are really correct, in a way.  But \"aaa drive\" should probably be called \"aaa driveway\" or \"aaa parking lot\", because there is not much of a road there.",

Not only did they take forever to get the paperwork done, they called and told us to return documents as soon as possible so that our approved loan will get completed.

I took the mail to Bank of America and told them about the problem. I spent much personal time on many occasions to bring it to their attention.

I bank with Charles Schwab, which is awesome on rates, zero fees, range of banking/lending/brokerage/retirement services, customer service, and  super hip technology.  I don't expect Schwab-level performance from other banks, but my first mortgage, for example, is with Wells Fargo, and they at least auto-debit my payment every month like a normal modern bank so I never have to deal with their bureaucratic customer service in the first place. \n\nI'll get to RBC's customer service in a minute.  But first, let's talk about the fact that they offer me no option to even make a payment online, much less to choose auto debit.  What's more, they send me a paper bill every month WITH NO RETURN ENVELOPE so I have to go buy a freaking box of envelopes, buy stamps, write out addresses, and then find a mailbox to drop my bill in.  Over four years, this has become a tremendous hassle. \n\nAs for the customer service, I've had to deal with them several times when my bill didn't show (lost in the mail - shocker!) or when my payment didn't arrive at their offices (lost in the mail room - shocker!).  They pretty consistently do what they can to not think (the robotic, canned response voice of a complacent bureaucrat - you know the sound) and not be helpful.  The people in the branches are nicer, but definitely not snappy.\n\nIf your mortgage broker turns these guys up, I'd recommend paying a couple extra basis points on your rate and going with a real bank.  The lack of time wasted buying envelopes and dealing with customer service will be well worth it over time.",

While stopped on the on-ramp, this crazy ass woman whom I had been eying in my rear view for at least 5 minutes while making snide comments about her crazy hair to myself, SLAMS INTO ME going at least 40mph. I spin onto the gravel and slap my head against the driver side window obviously shocked and wondering what the fuck just happened. I get out of my car, donned in stilettos and all, and strut through the gravel shaking my finger and explaining to her the rules of driving and how she, clearly, was not obeying them. Thank you for the whiplash and for ruining my day. Luckily, for me, she and her totaled 1999 Chevy Cavalier were fully equipped with Geico Auto Insurance. \n\nNow, I have always thought the gecko commercials were a little silly, but man, these people do no mess around when it comes to accidents. Within ONE HOUR of my collision, I had received a phone call making sure I was alright. Within 4 hours I had already been offered an inconvenience check along with medical bill coverage for up to 2 months.. Since I hit my head pretty hard, I had to decline.. to cover my own ass just in case something is really wrong. Their estimator came to us to give the verdict on the damage.. and cut a check on the spot. Everything, for the most part, was taken care of within the first 24 hours, including my rental car which they are obviously paying for as well. I have received letters in the mail and phone calls everyday and have not been intimidated or disappointed with anyone i've dealt with. \n\nI myself do not have Geico, but rest assured, if the person who slams into you does, god forbid, your life isn't over.. they are extremely helpful and professional, and genuinely do care about you.",

The appraiser did a quick walk through my high end home and then ended up just going off comps... the tax records showed $50k higher!  The loan officer David Jordan kept giving us closing dates and then blowing them.  Then was aggravated when I would call him... you know- the old next day, next day, next day routine... or, you know the mortgage business... And the title company was just as lackadaisical. And the closing costs 4.5 points!!  But you know it's a hard money loan (I was told) thus giving them the right to charge outlandish fees on all line items. Well I guess I'm i Vegas and loan sharking is the norm.  I did close because they wasted so much time...  Even if you have a normal loan... I'd go somewhere else.\nWelcome to freedom of speech, Southern Fidelity Mortgage!",

First they said We'd be closing at end of Feb, then beginning of March, then end of March. Here we are in April and we still have not closed. Every time we have a delay they come back and want more bank statements, more pay stubs, soon they will be needing my 2015 returns.

We checked in with a rep and he had told us to have a seat and that he'll be right with us as soon as he helps the couple in front of us. As we were waiting, three other parties had checked in with another rep, Henry, for help. When the first rep was done with the first couple, Henry brought the party who arrived after us into the room. We had told him that we've been waiting to see someone for over 45 minutes and that we were next in line. Henry told us that because we had not checked in with him to begin with we would have to be seen after every one else who checked in. That's 3 different parties, mind you. It was a little disappointing to have came early and waited long before everyone else to be seen. Apparently Henry was not familiar with playing fair. Shame on you Henry. Shame on you.",

Today I had a very unpleasant experience with Jose, who seemed to make it his personal pleasure over my loss and basically told me that I was stupid in an indirect way. I completely gave up on using this location, though it is the closest to my home.\nThe lady upfront was very nice, but the bottom line it is not only about how nice the people that work here are, but how efficient and competent they are.\nEven while waiting for my appointment (it was on time) I witnessed how a banker kept telling a lady at the window phrases like \"I don't know\" \"I am not sure\" until she asked him to go ask someone else who knew the answer to her question. My previous time I had the same experience with the same banker. \nI don't know if it's improper training or poor people skills, but it is unprofessional and I wouldn't trust these specific people to handle my business.\nAfter I spent 4 hours in total today for going back and forth between locations for minor thing, I ended up going back to my old branch, where they were surprised, that people (Jose in particular) at this location gave me hard time over minor issue. \nI spoke with the manager over the phone later on. She was nice, but didn't seem to care to listen to my side of the story, her attitude was as if she already knew everything she needed to know and in resolution she decided to speak with employees at the other branch as if they were wrong by accommodating a customer (me).

Well I have been in Chandler for almost a year now and I am still getting the personalized service from Brian and his team as if I was still next door. I made the right decision not to change agents.

However, I can make a safe bet that he is an amazing agent soley based on the team he's surrounded by. First off, hats off to Bonnie. My dad has been with State Farm well over 20 years and he can not say enough great things about her. I'd also like to recognize Clayton, who helped initiate my insurance with State Farm. He explained everything clearly from the get-go so there were never any, not so pleasant, surprises down the road. Finally but DEFINITELY NOT least, the newest team member I have spoken to has gone absolutely above and beyond any expectations I would EVER hold for any person but especially as an insurance agent. I always felt that insurance companies were out to get you the highest rate to extort as much money out of you as they can. Oh boy, did Rob prove me wrong! Rob is, by far, the best team member I've spoken to! (Although not to deminish the value of all the other hard-working team members) All in all I guess what I am trying to say is as long as you come to THIS State Farm Branch, you are in good hands (even if you don't speak directly to Brian Stevens) becuase his team is professional, very courteous and, according my standards, very genuine/honest people.",

I wanted to pay off a credit card that I had through them, and had several issues with their services which is why I also wanted to close out my accounts there.  For starters, if you use their bill pay, you have to submit things about 10 days early so that their pre-historic systems have time to get the payment back in time so you don't get a penalty. Terrible. \n\nWhen I went to close my accounts, I couldn't because I had a $9000 (approximate payoff) credit card with them, so they would not let me close my checking/savings until I paid that off.  The following month, I went to pay it off, with a DEBIT CARD, not a credit card.  The teller (was a young guy) decides to run it as credit and a cash advance without telling me and they cost me $274.92 in fees for being careless.  My card says Debit and I was on the phone with my other bank right in front of him increasing my daily debit limit so it could be ran as debit and then he fails to tell me that they don't have the capability to run it as debit.  There is a chase bank 1.3miles from there and I could have easily gone and got a check to pay it off or cash, and would not have been an issue.  On top of that, after I paid the $9000+, they wanted another $18 for interest that he didn't think to include in the payoff...just more inconvenience from FCU.\n\nOh, and they have the oldest and worst website I've ever seen.  For a company that holds a lot of money, you would think they could invest in an upgrade on the website.....and they have a tab called \"More Cool Stuff\"  --- Are you kidding me???

    "text": "FIRST IN NAME ONLY...THIS PLACE IS THE WORST CREDIT UNION IN ARIZONA!!!\n\nI recently moved to Arizona and belong to a credit union back home. My credit union is a \"member\" of the shared branch arrangement that creates a nationwide network where you can bank anywhere in the country.\n\nWell, I had an important transaction to handle, and was in need of a Medallion Guarantee Stamp. I called several credit unions in the Phoenix/Chandler area and many said that they did not provide that service at all, so when I contacted FCU and was told that they could stamp my documents I was elated.\n\nUpon my arrival, I was told to sign in and that someone would assist me shortly. I waited approximately 15 minutes without any further acknowledgement while two employees held what sounded to be a personal conversation. When one of the women finally came over to help me, she did not introduce herself, or display any customer service etiquette. I explained my situation and she promptly told me that they could not help me because I was not one of their customers.\n\nI told her that I phoned the branch prior to driving over there, and was told that they could, in fact, provide the Medallion Guarantee. She asked me if I spoke to the call center and I said yes. She phoned someone to ask if my information was correct, and laughed throughout the entire conversation with the person on the other end of the phone. She hung up and again told me that they could not help me because I was not a \"member\" of their credit union.\n\nOf course I was frustrated because they had not only wasted my time, but their poorly trained staff gave out incorrect information despite placing me on hold several times during my initial call. \n\nLong story short, this was the most unprofessional, substandard level of customer service that I have ever experienced from a supposed \"shared branch\". This person didn't even bother to ask if I would be willing to open up an account. However, after the despicable customer service that she exhibited, I would never consider doing business with First Credit Union. \n\nI am happy report that I went to Chase Bank about a mile away, and was pleasantly surprised.  I received the most OUTSTANDING customer service from the Assistant Branch manager. I explained my situation to her, and she went above and beyond what I expected. They had the same policy of not providing the Medallion stamp for  non-customers, but her approach was very impressive and a stark contrast to my experience at FCU. It's abundantly clear that Chase places a premium on customer service and FCU does not. \n\nI am happy to report that I opened an account on the spot. CHASE ROCKS!!!",

Michael called me ahead of time that he will be running late and that was cool.  It was inclement weather at 4/25/2015 around 8:30pm.  He showed up around 9:15pm and that is okay for us tonight.  He also brought lots of different colored pens which I acknowledged my signature with a blue pen.  Good he had one on him.  He was thorough, helpful, knowledgeable and passionate to do this mobile notary service.  Price is fair being that it is at night and on a weekend.  The nature of my brother and my work, waiting on UPS to save money is not worth it.  Mike's mobile notary is worth the extra coin for us.",

Taylor and his staff were very helpful and he was able to reduce my debt by 50% along with negotiating a payment schedule.

My husband got a quote and made appointment for afternoon. When he arrived, he told the man at the counter that he did not want the high performance oil (they try to sell you this) and that the regular oil for his truck was what he wanted. \nWell, when the work was done , my husband was presented with a bill for $59.00 and on the bill it stated he was given the high performance oil---needless to say, he was furious when he saw this !  Also, the quote we were given was $24.95 on the phone---they do not inform you, the customer, that they charge a $5.00 fee , a installation charge for the oil---and an extra fee to dispose of the oil. \nI was not present at the time of this transaction so when I was told by my husband what had happened , I called the place and Tom Bates answered the phone. I asked what they had charged for the service and told him you charged us for something we did not ask for. He was lying through his teeth when he said my husband wanted the high performance oil change--NOT!!   What really is funny is that on the bill there is a paragraph that states \"if you are not satisfied for any reason contact Tommy Bates to give you the opportunity to achieve our goal\". Well, I received no satisfaction when I called to complain so I called the customer service number at the AAA office and registered a formal complaint with them regarding the service.  If the matter is not resolved to our satisfaction I will be contacting the Attorney General's office for the state of NC as well as the BBB in Charlotte. We will never use their services again and I am thinking of cancelling my membership altogether. If any of you folks out there plan to use this place for your car care, please make sure you write out your own instructions as to what you want done so that you have proof as to what you told them---they bait and switch and change your order without your permission. This AAA car care center is located in Matthews on Independence Blvd.",

I told them that I do not need rotors and that the front brakes were squeaking.  They pulled the car into the bay then LOOKED at the car for about 10 minutes and came to the conclusion( without touching it at all) that I needed rotors on the back and new brakes.  \n\nThey gave me a quote on the job and began work.  I also asked for a balance and rotation.  After they received the new rotors from across the street they promptly put them on and put the tires back on without doing the balance/rotation.  \n\nI brought it to their attention that the front brakes are what I wanted done and they restated that the front was fine since they checked it (LIE) but they still had not looked at the front brakes.  I tell them that this is not true and also that the tires have been put back on the car but the balance/rotation has not been done.  They were going to have me pay for a 40 service that I never received (potential costly LIE of OMISSION).\n\nShe then tells me if I want them to check to see if there is something wrong with the front brakes it will cost an additional 50.00.  I am too livid to think straight at this point and tell her to forget it since I will be charged an extra 50 in order to have them do what I brought the car there for in the first place.  \n\nWhen they finally finish after about two hours the price ended up being well over 330 (another LIE) since I was not quoted anything like that.  \n\nLastly, when I get ready to leave they hand me a broken emblem from the center of my wheel and told me that it was broke when I got there.  I had driven over 60 miles before I pulled into their parking lot and I am sure that if it was broken it would have fallen off before now.   The reason it broke is because of one of the techs was handling my car tire like it was a basket ball.  That is what broke it.  I will not use any AAA Car Care Center ever again.  I will use ANYBODY BUT AAA Car Care.  They have all but ruined the name of a very respected company.",

The staff are courteous if not exactly cheerful, the place is clean and it has a decent waiting area from which you can see inside the shop (could be good if you're watching what's happening to your car, or bad if a visit to the repair shop for you is kinda like going to the dentist - a painful wait to find out just how much money it will cost you). \n\nWith the tire rotation, I just managed to drive back onto Independence when it became clear the car is not driving in a straight line anymore. Back I go: Apparently the tires were worn out in a way that didn't allow for rotating them anymore. They hadn't noticed that before. \n\nAfter my 30 dollar oil change, I got a quote for another half dozen repairs that according to them needed to be done and would have totalled close to 1000 dollars. Thankful for the pointers, but since I was having no car trouble, a three page quote of stuff that \"needs\" to be done seems like they're trying hard to squeeze money out of me. Although to be fair, I am no expert on cars, so I can't say too much on how fair their quote was.\n\nThe inspection and tire change was fine, except for the wait. They said getting the tires would take 45 minutes. It ended up taking them 1.5 hours, and with changing them, the inspection and various wait times in between, I spent over three hours at the shop. \n\nLastly, I am a AAA member, which should give you 10 percent off labor at AAA car care centers. I asked if they needed to see my AAA card, they said no. No discount applied. I had to ask right-out for the discount on the labor costs before they granted it. \n\nI came here for the credibility and fairness that I hoped the AAA name would guarantee, but I think I'll now give somewhere else a try.",

I was not there for the initial meeting but my partner fell in love with the house and Richard . \n\nOnce we made an offer, Richard worked tirelessly to make it ours. We had some snags with the mortgage company that were very irritating and frustrating but Richard got on their case and got it done.\n\nHe was at the closing with me after-hours and did not leave until the last document was signed. \n\nDuring the process,  I had an eye doctor appointment that conflicted with some document signing so Richard came to the appointment with me and waited while I got new glasses. That is real customer service.\n\nAfter the closing he checked in to make sure all was well and that we were happy. \n\nI really hope that you give them a chance whether buying or selling as the will go to the moon and back to make sure you are taken care of.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Give them a call and tell them I sent you. You will not be sorry.",

    "text": "In the past two weeks I have had the absolute WORST experience of my life with Chase Bank.The short story is DO NOT BANK WITH CHASE!\n\n Last week right before I was leaving to go on vacation at 5am I used my card to fill up my gas. It declined three times before I called to figure out what was wrong. After a 10 min. wait to talk to someone they said they cancelled my card. NO ONE  contacted me. The lady was so rude. She said that there was nothing I could do except wait for the card in the mail. (Erin from San Antonio calling center) Or I could call EVERY SINGLE time I made a purchase while I was on vacation. How inconvenient is that?! Who wants to call every 10 minutes, and then wait a half hour to talk to someone to get a charge approved? No one! I asked her for a direct number to call so I wouldn't get the run around on the customer service menu. She told me the number but I was driving so I asked her if she could email me the number. (Reasonable request right?) NO she told there was NO email in her office. I asked if she couldn't email me, or if there was absolutely no email at all in her office. Erin then replied that there was NO form of email in her office and there was nothing she could do. Imagine that, Chase National Bank with no email at all? What a liar, I get emails all the time from Chase. So I went in saying how that seemed completely ridiculous and theres no possible way that was true. I asked if she never got any departmental emails, or her work schedule sent to her... again she said NO. After talking to this hyaenas woman she transferred me to someone else while she stayed on the line. Cindy got on the line and the first question I asked was if she email in her office. Her answer was simple and sweet YES. So of course I was immediately furious. Cindy followed up by saying they were not allowed to email customers directly but the damage was done. I understand the rule completely but for Erin to lie over and over seemed so disrespectful like I am so stupid to believe you don't have email?! After the fact Erin could not even admit she had lied. I told her I would not move forward discussing the original reason why I called until she could admit she had lied. She didn't for another half hour until I got hung up on! The entire call Erin kept talking over me and was so so so rude. I thought that was the worst customer service ever! However I was wrong. \nIt is a week and a half later and I have not received my new card. (Go figure) so I had to call Chase once more. The guy named Derek told me to get a new card I'd have to wait 5-7 business days or go into a chase store and wait 15 min for a new card. I explained to him that the card should've already been at my door so I did not want to go all the way down to the branch to fix THEIR mistake! he said thats ok then it will take 5-7 business days. I asked if there was any way to get the card sooner. He said NO. All I could do was go down to the branch. After going back and forth about the poor quality of customer service he said there was a 2 day shipping option but it would cost me $5. (So he lied. There was another option) I explained to him that I shouldn't be charged for my card getting shipped when they had already shut down my card for almost two weeks.He told me there was nothing he could do to remove the charge. He said once the charge was made I could call back and have the charged removed. I told him I DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY AT ALL and I would not trust them to take off the charge at a later date. Besides whats the difference between taking the charge off, and never charging me to begin with? He said well let me see what I can do... He then said he found away to remove the charge on his end. (Again another lie, he knew how to do it and just told me there was nothing he could do.) \nSo now my card will hopefully be here in two days but if I am not sitting at home all day waiting to pick it up UPS will not leave it at the door, I will then have to go pick it up from the store. \n\nMoral of the story DO NOT BANK WITH CHASE unless you want to be lied to over and over, spend hours on the phone talking to disrespectful \"customer service\" agents who can not do anything, have your money held hostage, and want to pay money to have Chase fix their own mistakes.\nI can't believe that these are the idiots I have been trusting with my money. Needless to say I will be closing my account and banking with someone who is smarter and has a caring customer service team.",

I had an accident and my car is no longer young so I was not surprised that it would technically be totaled though I knew it could be fixed. What was surprising and infuriating was the poor service in the claims process. The adjuster did not look at my car within 48 hours as promised. When I finally got it, I felt the first settlement offer was low, I could even find an nearly identical car on Car Soup selling for $500 more. Furthermore, I had been taking care of my car it had recently had a new head gasket, new tires and new stereo.  None of this mattered to the adjusters( and I did take this up the management chain)  they basically refused to negotiate, saying they would lower their offer rather than raise it. Since I have relatives who are adjusters , I know this is not how it should go. I also did not get a written copy of the  repair estimate until 12 days after the accident. \n\nThe good news for me is that I found a great body shop that fixed my car and wonderful insurance agent at another company.",

    "text": "If there was an option to give negative stars, I would. Here's the story. In 2013 I was suckered into signing a contract by this sales man who wasn't even part of the legal team but some hot blooded car dilership material who was so pushy about bankruptcy promising life changing experience. So I signed it, on behalf of my husband. Two months after we paid the full deposit, a bunch of his old debt disappeared from his credit report, I mean more than 90% of it. ( we still had to pay tax on it!!!!) So we waited, and 2 years later he is left with about 4k to pay off. We never gave them any paperwork to work on nor we called to ask for advise. For the past two weeks we have been calling and leaving numerous voicemails, yet we didn't receive a call back. A judgement was filled and my husbands wages are being garnished. I walked into the office to drop of the paperwork for the garnishment hoping attorney could take a look at it and see if he could stop it and negotiate a settlement if we paid a smaller amount in full. The receptionist said the only way to stop it is to file. Seriously? To file BK for $ 4,000.00 debt???!!! Or I could call myself and see if that creditor would be willing to do it. Well that's way I paid attorney, to do it for me, so I wouldn't have to deal with these things myself! So, we decided to cancel their service and today I finally talked to Brock Best and he said that he cannot refund me ANY money because of their services such as answering the questions and stuff like that. I told him I never called them about anything and that I was promised , and I truly was, if I ever decided to break the contract I would have to pay admin fee plus hourly rate for attorney that he spent working on my case which was ZERO in my case. Brock Best told me something new today he said there's nothing to refund, it costs you $125  a month to retain us under the claw \"x\" and that's much more than $2650 that we put as a deposit leading me to belive that he doesn't need to do a thing for us because it turns out that the cost of retaining his services exceeded the cost of deposit. What a bunch of crap. Nobody ever made me feel so helpless and robbed as he did today. It wasn't easy to pay him $2650 and today he used his status of attorney to make me feel like he knows better and that I can't do anything about it.  I'm so mad. Wish I never dealt with Pew Law Center.There are so many other things he could had suggested such as writing a hardship letter saying that the wage garnishment would cause us hardship , there are ways to stop it but since he already collected our money he isn't interested in our case anymore. I know I am venting right now, but if you are trying to find a good attorney , please avoid these scammers because they do not care about you. They are heartless and have no interest in your case, they would never give you a professional advise that works in your best interest but what's easiest to them. Look further, avoid Pew Law Center.",

    "text": "Pew Law Center seems wonderful at first, but goes downhill. My fianc\u00e9 was left with a significant amount of debt following a divorce. He contacted Pew, set up an appointment,  met with them, and set up a payment plan. Everything seemed great! Following completing the payments, no one had contacted him to begin the process. He had contacted them several times via phone and email with no luck. Several MONTHS following the completion of payments went by before he heard anything, which he only heard from them after deciding it was too late to file bankruptcy due to the wedding. Then they attempt to convince him to continue to file,  as bad as a used car salesman. Out of the $2000 he paid them he got around $200 back because of \"administrative\" fees. They did NOTHING in the time he was paying them. Very poor customer service. They even suggested putting getting a marriage license on hold, are you kidding me?! So all the money that has been spent on the wedding would be a waste because they require a marriage license. I am really disappointed in Pew Law Center. They fooled him into something and refuse to make their failure in communication right. I highly encourage others to look elsewhere for debt relief. If this review would have been written in the beginning it would have  been completely different. Their true side didn't come out until later on! \n\nI will give credit where it's due though, the tax department was great! They worked with him and his situation for a much more positive outcome than expected.  \n\nThey should have made their mistake right and feelings would likely have been different as well, but their lack of communication and incredible difficulty getting a hold of them was detrimental.  \n\nPlease look elsewhere when it comes to debt relief. Save yourself from what we have lost!",

Was seen almost 50 minutes past my appt time.\n\n- Person I spoke to was a goofy guy who first insulted the part of town I live in, then proceeded to do the kind of sales pressure and pitch you expect on a used car lot.  Tried to tell me that paying the fees for bankruptcy is like investing in your future - better than stocks or bonds.  Seriously?  Then gave me moderate pressure to sign up then and there for a payment plan until I told him NO, I wouldn't be making any final decisions today\n\n- They pretty much wouldn't answer several of my questions without me paying them first to retain their services. So much for the FREE consult where you are encouraged to ask questions.\n\nThis place is like the Midway Cheverolet of law offices.  Stay away from here please!  Their low rating is completely earned.  They are a churn and burn place that does not respect you or your time. They just want their $2100.00 fees. Wished I looked them up on Yelp first before driving 40 miles to their stinky offices.\n\nPROS:\n\n????????????????",

It is easy to get an appointment and you are in and out of there quickly. Also I'd like to add they are much more inexpensive than H&R Block and other tax services like that. H&R Block wanted to charge me $500 to prepare my taxes and Fox and Peterson only charged me $160.00. They have done my taxes for the last few years now. They build personal relationships with their clientele so that always makes your visits even more comfortable and less stressful. If you are in the beauty business Tyson is the one to talk too, he specializes in that area of taxes. If you ever need anything throughout the year they are always there to answer your phone calls or emails.",

I just left this h&r block after experiencing the worst customer service, unprofessional ism, and rudest confrontation I have ever experienced in my life as a customer. What started as a very unfortunate situation was just worsend by the staff there, including the store manger John Broad. I had my taxes done by a rep there who quoted me a rate, which I paid, but then said I could pick up the rest of my paperwork the following day (an amendment to last years return). I had been there for the second time for 2 hours and 45 minutes as she completed my return so I appreciated that I could leave (after paying $400) and return to pick up my final portion. I called everyday after that to find out if it was ready to be picked up and almost a week later I got the awful news she had passed away. I understood these workers had lost a co-worker and the completion of my taxes would take a little longer than I expected. After offering to go elsewhere I was booked to pick up the amendment today, a week after originally planned.. They tried to charge me an additional $100 for this portion when my tax rep had told me it was included in the amount I paid at my appointment and I could just pick up the paperwork. I informed them of this and they looked up the information from my bill and said she didn't make note of this. I  reinforced  that I had already paid and she said I wouldn't owe anything more. 2 employees (including the store owner)  proceeded to yell at me that she would never say this, that they have worked with her before and this would never happen, and they couldn't believe I would take advantage of a situation like this. I was appalled by these accusations and their clear disinterest in any sort of customer service or for standing by the verbal agreement between me and one of their employees. This was an attack on my character and went way beyond any tax return discussion. I am an honest, hard working customer that deserves to be treated a whole lot better. Needless to say, after 3 weeks of working with them I refused to pay the $100 and left without my paperwork in tears. I found this office came far from delivering on their satisfaction guarantee and I hope  to have it somewhat rectified at the regional level. I would never step foot in this place of business again.

She was very practical when instructing us in the smartest way to pay toward the next tax year and didn't charge us an arm and a leg to do it. She told us what we could do feasibly to help prepare them and then took over to do the rest of the work that would have caused us major headaches. I am grateful we found Sapphire Bookkeeping and would recommend them to anyone. They made the process of hiring an accountant affordable, stress free, and always were prompt answering questions. If you're on the fence please look at these reviews and consider them seriously for your tax needs. We had a great experience!",

    "text": "I feel like when I'm in a pinch, YELP really comes through for me.  I was looking to switch accountants for my tax prep this year.  I initially asked a bunch of friends and colleagues but was not sold on any one that they suggested (mostly b/c the rates would have been as much as my State return).  I found Sapphire after requested quotes on YELP.  Jonathan was very timely with email correspondence and I was able to schedule an appointment within a couple of days *in the last week in March!\nI could tell immediately I was going to like this business when they presented me with an invoice of the work they would do and the fees upfront.  I can't tell you how many times I've asked an accountant what the rate would be...I get one number and then after the work is done..I'm shell shocked with a bill that is twice as much if not more.  \nCindy did my tax prep.  She was very personable and knowledgeable.  If she didn't have an immediate answer to my question, she knew where to find it and did so in a timely manner.  I have to say, this was probably the easiest and smoothest experience I've ever had with an accountant.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!",

In fact, after moving to back to the Washington DC area two years ago, I did, but was very unhappy with the service I received.  I asked Shayne if she could refer me to someone in the area...happily I learned she is able to prepare taxes in other states as well (I initially assumed she could not).  Even remotely, Shayne provides the personalized, professional and knowledgeable tax preparation I knew and expected.  She worked hard to understand the tax nuances of Virginia, and I am very thankful for that.  If you're looking for a someone who will go out of their way to ensure you get the best possible results, please give your business business to Shayne.  I promise you will be very happy with your decision.",

We spent an extremely productive hour looking at different scenarios and \"what if'ing\" ideas. Shayne did an excellent job evaluating my situation and responding to my inquiries. She has a knack for explaining when appropriate, but not when unnecessary so as to make our time more productive.

    "text": "The thought of buying a house can be a scary process especially when you don't know the legal jargon of all the papers you will be signing. I was fortunate enough to have been recommended Jody by friends. \n\nFrom the beginning, he sat down with me, and I explained my financial situation and told him an estimate for a mortgage that I would be comfortable with. He calculated my debt to income ratio, and told me what I would most likely be approved for. He then had me gather documents that would be needed throughout the process (before I even started looking). \n\nOnce I submitted my offer, and had my loan process started, I hardly even had to think about the process. It was almost too perfect, but it was because all my documents were ready to go when the funding bank asked for them. If there were any issues, Jody was prompt with his correspondence, and contacted me both my email and phone. During the month long process, he would update me on my status, without being asked. When I went to go to my closing signing, he was there to answer any questions I had with the documents, and was straightforward with his answers.\n\nI've never bought a house, and I've heard many horror stories about the loan process. I'm grateful that I didn't have that same experience. Jody knows his stuff. He's prompt with his responses and will spare you all the commercial b.s. that others use to manipulate you. For example... the house I bought required a pre-approval letter from another bank. This bank was giving me a difficult time and was delaying my escrow process. Jody stepped in, provided the representative with the required paperwork, and asked that the approval letter be processed immediately so I could proceed with my escrow. The representative quickly changed her tune. Apparently these banks try to offer incentives to gain your business and end up costing people more money at the end. \n\nI can't say how much I appreciate Jody's help. Like I said, my process was so much smoother than what I pictured, and it was because he anticipated all the games that banks might play and he's willing to help No question is ever too stupid - he'll answer them all (I asked tons!).  If I had to do it again, I would go with Jody, and I would have NO problem recommending him to anyone else.",

Nope when I walked back in the manager said there is still nothing they could do for me .

I physically visit the location on Horizon ridge but I've done online/direct deposit the last few times and upon receiving the satisfaction survey this is the location the link brings me to - I'm assuming the agent processing my app works at this location.  When you process an online app it is very idiot-proof (website navigating-wise) and a rep will call you soon after.  Three times now I've gotten the same, sweet girl by the name of Britney (spelling?) to process and complete my loan.  She is very professional and friendly - same goes to the reps I've visited at Horizon ridge.  The entire process is discrete and while I avoided short term loans before because of the taboo - it has been my saving grace in times of need.  Very untrue that these reps will hassle your references - only if you default.  I've always been quick to pay off my loans which is how it should be when using them bc the interest can rack up reeeeaaaal quick.  \n\nBottom line: I believe if you are a risk-worthy customer who will pay off quickly or bare minimum, make on time payments, then you will have a great experience.",

State Farm is great, but even more fantastic when you do business with Kevin and Marilyn. The State Farm offices here in Yuma couldn't even recognize my husband's name after 5 years of doing business with them. We haven't been married a year and Kevin and his crew know his name without looking on the policy. Made a claim this morning and less than 30 minutes I got a call from their office.

    "text": "With all the fed rates plummeting, and my money barely earning more than inflation in my Wamu savings account, I decided to transfer a large portion of my savings over to Arizona Bank & Trust.  \n\n**I interrupt this review for an important news flash: Arizona Bank & Trust currently has a 6.01% APY rewards checking account with a $20K cap on it. This blows away any online savings account out there, and best of all the money is liquid -- you can access it at any time you please. There are three basic requirements: \n\n1) Sign up for e-statements (easy - and one of the bankers will call you up and help walk you through it if you have trouble with it. If you're on Yelp, I figure you can navigate a computer though).  \n\n2) Make 12 signature-based debit transactions a month. This means don't use your pin, and run it as a credit card. You can buy 12 packs of gum. Or buy 10 cents worth of gas 12 times. You can also use it to pay online utilities. This is not a hard requirement to fulfill, really. \n\n3) Direct depost OR ACH bill pay. This is great, because as a student, I don't have easy access to direct deposit, so I just used my AZB&T account to pay my Cox cable bill online - just make sure to use your bank account # and routing # to pay the bill, because if you use your debit card # it will NOT go through as an ACH debit.\n\nThe other thing that makes this deal a beauty is that the 6.01% rate is guaranteed until April 2009. Guaranteed. 12 blissful months of earning twice as much interest as my stinky online savings accounts. \n\nSo after doing my research, I headed on over to the AZB&T branch down the street from me. From the moment I stepped through the door, I received very attentive service. I've had a bit of experience signing up for bank accounts, and the process was similar to most. Unfortunately, the day I was there the entire computer system had shut down, so they had to hand write my application and enter it after I left. Also, my initial deposit slip was handwritten -- which seemed a bit shady. And sure enough, the next day I noticed $2000 had been taken out of my other bank account, not the full $20,000 that I had written the deposit check for. AZB&T immediately caught their error though, requested the remaining amount, and it was in my account within the next couple of days.\n\nBased on my initial experience, you'd think I would rate the bank poorly, but even through all the mishaps the bankers were very apologetic and professional and they followed up with several calls throughout the next week.  In fact, I have definitely gotten on a first name basis with a couple of the bankers there, and every time I call, I just have to say my full name and they know immediately who I am. I haven't gotten this kind of personalized service since leaving my teeny tiny hometown in Hickville, AZ. \n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give my experience at AZB&T 5 stars is because the whole application process from beginning to end is a bit on the slow side, and the computers crashing was a bit of a nuisance. The friendliness and accessibility of the staff, however, has made it a real pleasure to bank here despite the few hiccups. I sent my friend over to sign up, and he's had no issues so far. \n\nAsk for Nicci or Nicole and tell them Heather S. sent you!",

The last several years banking with them has become very disappointing.  The staff in the branches are always very pleasant, that's certainly not the issue.  One major problem is they have closed so many locations!  I used to have 3 within a 10 mile radius, now the closest location is 14 miles away.  The inconvenience is bad enough, but they can no longer seem to get their low balance alert working.  I keep a spending balance in checking, then transfer funds as needed to cover my bills.  Their low balance alert used to work.  I've contacted them 4 times regarding this problem and each time I've been assured the problem has been resolved.  It hasn't been, and I refuse to call a 5th time!  It's time to focus my energy on finding a more convenient, more capable banking institution.",

Why was it so confusing? Because my daughter just turned 12 and according to these idiots at Desert Schools, she wasn't able to cash her check because she didn't have a \"government issued ID.\" What 12 year old kid has a driver's license or state issued ID? NONE!!!\nMaybe I should be more understanding. I'm sure it's the 12 year old girls of the world who are trying to swindle financial institutions out of their hard earned money, 25 dollars at a time.\nDesert Schools, you lost another customer, but more importantly, you really should be ashamed of yourselves for treating children this way!",

Stay clear--this is my experience with Desert Schools.\nWent in to discuss an auto refinance. Had great credit -no problems. They advertise 60 months-that is what I wanted. Came to an agreement for the 60 month loan and was told the documents would be ready the following day.  Came in the next day to sign and was handed the loan documents and--they had written in 63 months.  After a discussion on the absurdity of what they had done--I was in a predicament as I was out of time-had to take it.\nI had opened a savings and checking account previously as they required these accounts in place for the loan. They lied to me about how the savings account would back up the checking and started hitting me with penalties -which is just the opposite of what I was told.\nThey have been trying to gouge me on fees and penalties ever since.\nWithout  qualification this is the worst, most unethical financial institution I have ever dealt with.\nHad to give 1 star --not only would I give them 0 stars I would like to see them shut down.

Plus, at my old job, my crazy boss dealt with SEVEN different banks of which he had me personally take deposits to each (sometimes on the same day, fun drive...not) so I feel well qualified to judge it in comparison to other banks.\n\nAnyways, on with the review already...I love Desert Schools. I don't see myself ever switching to another bank for any purpose. I have been banking with them for 4 years and have never had even one issue. In fact, they often resolve issues for me, such as removing those nasty little NSF fees. I always have a really pleasant experience when I go in, all of the tellers are super friendly and are well-trained. I also never have to wait in much of a line. \n\nIn comparison to the several other banks I used to deal with, I feel that DS takes the time to educate each of their employees far more than other banks. I also feel as if they don't pressure you to open other services. Many of the the banks that I used to deposit at for my old boss would constantly hound me about opening up another account, or line of credit, etc. \n\nIf anyone talks about bank issues, I always find myself raving about my wonderful banking experiences!!! Thank you Desert Schools for being awesome!",

Little did I know that was going to be the biggest mistake in banking I ever made. Sure, this bank starts out looking like a good idea, and then you realize that there are little to no ATM's in the valley, and the customer service is sub-par. After a few months I decided to close my account and move back to a big bank, and that's when all the BS started. A week after I closed my account, they reopened it and started charging fee's without an explanation. When I went into the bank to find out whats going on, they stood there and told me that they can do whatever they want without speaking to me. \nSo I paid them their stupid $5 fee and walked away thinking that this issue was closed.\n\nFour years later, I was looking at my credit report and noticed that One Nevada had charged off $105 with no explanation. I went over to the bank only to discover that they kept the fee's running just because they felt like it. After a long heated discussion, I demanded that they remove the charge off immediately. Their collections department decided that they would try to muscle me into backing off. These people are low class, unprofessional, and display some of the worst customer service I've ever seen.   \n\nI filed a small claims suit against them in 2015. It took a judge 15 minutes to realize that the bank violated several FTC laws, and quickly ruled in my favor. The bank was forced to remove the charge off for failure to communicate the charges with the customer. It turns out that they are all talk until you take them to court. All i can say is that if looks could kill, the look the bank rep gave me across the court room, would have done me in. \n\nThe Bottom Line - They are poorly trained, rude,and aggressive towards their customers, because most locals here lack the customer service skills that the rest of us learn in the real world. Save yourself a lot of trouble and don't do business with small Nevada banks. This experience has taught me that when I feel that the big banks are treating me wrong, it's far from the BS that people are putting up with at the local level.",

Because the credit card was in my Mom's name only they decided to keep all the money in their JOINT account and pay the credit card with it. I spoke with some real winner named Kathy and told her to let my sister take out the money she needs and I will pay the credit card in full when the bill arrives. She said ' We are not a bank and that's not how we do business\"....Wtf!!!  I told her to just keep the money that's in the account and good luck getting the rest of the balance from me!!!   Heartless bastards!!!",

So, I don't really plan on banking much there but I did have to open a checking account in order to get a loan. The loan process itself was relatively smooth, quick and hassle free. I got an awesome 2.98 interest rate. Teresa Popp was my loan closer and she was very nice and friendly. She has been more than helpful.\n\nI might see how the ATM only use could frustrate people, but I am not going to be using them much for that. However, I don't see the big deal. My main bank that I use, I do everything online and through ATM. Makes life easier that way. Who would want to go inside and deal with a teller all the time? Anyway..If you want a loan for something you should try them out, as I had a good experience.",

    "text": "Still haven't needed to use customer service (and I'm honestly considering this a good thing) but I wanted to make a quick update for anyone looking into making the switch to One Nevada. In my experience, major banks can take pretty much forever to put a check through if they feel like it and you only have access to limited funds from the check. I've deposited my paychecks without any issue at One Nevada and once the deposit is approved (usually within hours on a weekday, understandably longer on the weekend) I have complete and total access to my money, which is really important to me as someone with a smaller income and a student loan to be paying off.\n\nThe main point for this update, though, is the efficiency with checks overall--I've deposited checks from Ebates and from relatives and I expected these to take much longer than my paychecks, which One Nevada is used to receiving from me, but sure enough I had the money from these checks ready and waiting for me within hours of using the mobile app to deposit them. I highly recommend the mobile app's deposit feature to anyone who has a smartphone and uses One Nevada, because it's simplified my finances so much.\n\nI'm bumping my review up to five stars because I can't see a real reason for subtracting a star over customer service when I haven't NEEDED it at all. With Chase I was calling nearly once a month to clear up some unknown charge or order a new debit card, so this is a refreshing change of pace. Will be back to update again if I do have any issues, to let Yelp know how One Nevada handles it!",

    "text": "While I have had some helpful service representatives from this place...I swear I have the worst issues with my account. At this rate I am having so many needless issues that I could just go back to a major nationwide big bank! The point of the credit union switch was that they would be better with service and more for the customer. I have had issues with traveling and you guys freezing my accounts and not having a way for me to get a hold of anyone over weekends or holidays! The most recent thing over this weekend is that I, as usual made my paycheck deposit on Friday. It clearly shows it was processed just after 7am on Saturday morning, yet this time suddenly my funds are not available?! Wth?! It is the holidays people have shopping to do, and gas to put in their tanks, and even holiday traveling. I have never had this issue with my paycheck before being clearly processed but still showing pending! I was under the impression the first $100 of every check had to be released regardless, per federal law. My limits are at $1500, and my check always clears as soon as the bank processes it, so within the same day or before opening the next day. Now my account transactions and bill pays have gone haywire! In the new year it sounds like I should just say screw it and switch back to a real bank where I can call someone 24/7...instead of not even being able to put gas in my car or use my card until you all have someone in the office! Epitome of \"banker's hours!\"",

    "text": "I have been a member of Nevada Federal Credit Union for 21 years and only ever had ONE problem.  When the notice to change to One Nevada Credit Union came I was concerned with what changes would really impact its members once the board got its way.  The paperwork and newsletters that came were so clearly one sided, I knew there had to be a negative side that was being over shadowed.  I read each notice that came with caution and attention to the details.  When I had questions, I called to have them answered.  I decided to vote against the change due to the changes in the Member's Rights and Notices.  It was clear that this would no longer be a \"Member's Credit Union.\"  I realized that most other members were likely to vote with the Board's advice to change and likely without reading the disclosures at all.  Now its members are starting to feel the results of change.  True enough and as I expected, the customer service has declined and the fees are on a steady increase.  I am saddened to say that this is no longer the credit union of choice.  Keep looking, there are other Credit Unions still out there with the original mindset of getting its members the maximum benefit at the lowest cost.  I am switching to one that has zero monthly fees, loan rates that are averaging 3% lower than One Nevada and it is still paying interest on their Checking and Savings accounts.  This is what this credit union used to be but I cannot recommend it anymore! :(",

He also called the company to complain about me with the twisted story, such as \"she grabbed me,\" \"she said -  do not change the tire,\" but no word about I was trying to see his ID. Dispatcher told me to let him changed the tire and wanted to talk to him. I passed my phone to him and he complains me about again lot of lie to protect him.  Besides, he states to the dispatcher \"put a note that this customer is rude\" in front of me.  I used more than a couple times AAA road service but never had this kind of rude guy. I've never complain their service even waiting for a long time under AZ heat in the summer (one time I waited for 2 hours).  I liked the service before but anymore. He was totally jerk.",

So it's off to the tire shop where they have to cut the tire stem off just to remove the spare. Then, off to another auto repair where they replace the tire stem. Then, back to the tire shop. So far, I'm not angry - it's just a mistake. Next , I file a claim for reimbursement and two weeks later a guy calls from AAA and leaves a message with no information about why he's calling. I don't hear from him again, so I send an email to membership services last night at 1:30am (working late for a big project today) and then 7:20am this morning he calls - to verify my address! This can't wait till after 8am? Seriously, after a month of waiting for my reimbursement, you've gotta call me at 7:20am to verify my address? the SAME address that's on my membership profile, my claim, and all the documentation submitted with the claim? And you couldn't mention in your first voice mail message that this was the purpose of your call?   \nI didn't get upset with the bungled job changing the flat tire, but the call this morning to verify my address at 7:20am put me over the edge. My girlfriend didn't get to sleep till after 2am because I was working late, and then this joker calls at 7:20am with a routine address-verification question. \nI've got AAA  Roadside Assistance and I've got Geico Roadside Assistance. Guess which one I'll be cancelling? One flat tire should not be this much trouble.",

Three days before, we FINALLY get confirmation. you want to see stressed? how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up front?\n\nbut the proverbial icing on the cake? we were advised to have our invitees \"donate\" a wedding gift to our wedding through the AAA travel website. that way, those guest that couldn't attend could still give us something and at the end, we'd get a check. \n\nunfortunately, it wasn't that easy. at no point were we informed that 10% of \"donations\" would be kept by AAA. furthermore, my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the AAA office to actually get our wedding \"donation\" check. it was always \"they're cutting the check today\"...a week later....\"they're cutting the check today\", etc. \n\nto summarize, i'll keep my AAA for cars only. their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, and untimely departments i've ever had to deal with. we would've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.",

    "text": "UPDATE:. After all the headache detailed below, I did finally speak with an individual who was able to fix my membership quickly and efficiently.  Finally someone who knew what they were doing!  And then I received a call from a supervisor or manager, who had read my post here and reviewed all of my calls to customer service. She listened to my complaint again and also compensated us for all the trouble.  I do appreciate when a company is willing to reach out and try to make things right so I have changed my rating from a 1 to a 3.  I do believe they need to better train some of their employees so hopefully this type of situation can be avoided in the future.  END OF UPDATE\n\nThis review is not about a particular location, but about AAA Arizona member services. \n\nI had been a AAA member since 1996.  Yes, 20 years!  Those 20 years were with AAA Southern New England.  When we moved to Arizona in May, I contacted AAA about transferring my membership.  Ended up having to call 2 different numbers and talked to 3 different people.  I was assured it would be no problem, although i couldn't exactly transfer it.  I had to give them all my info again for them to set up the AZ membership.  So I did, including my credit card info for the automatic renewal.  I explained that my current membership was set to end June 30.  No problem, I was told.  The AZ membership would take over then.  I get temp membership cards emailed to me.  I email back because the dates make no sense.  No response.  Then I get a bill in the mail, which makes no sense because it's telling me to pay by a date 3 weeks prior.  I go online and I see it says auto renewal.  I call again.  Yep, you're all set.  You can ignore that bill.  Your payment will be charged to your card on July 1.  Get another bill a few weeks later.  Still dates make no sense.  I call again, and told the same thing.  Ignore the bill.  Your cc will be billed July 1 and then your new cards will be sent.  You should get them 3rd week of July.  I ask...even though they'll be effective July 1, I won't have.  Yes, but it's no problem, they can just look up your membership to verify it.  Well now it's July 30 and still no cards.  So I try to log in and check my membership.  My membership number is no longer valid!   WTF!!!!   Checked my credit card statement, and I guess the bright spot is no charge either so at least I'm not paying for nothing.  But WTF!!!!   On Monday, I will be going to the local office and speaking with w human being face-to-face.  And  depending on the service I get here will determine if I renew my membership.  20 years!  5 phone calls and not a single person seems to know what they're doing because after 20 years, my membership that I was assured had been transferred, has actually been cancelled.",

Front desk woman gave me limited amount of literature, sold me $50 in books and tried to shoo me out door. I explained i called ahead and expected to be able to discuss my trip with a planner. They acted like that was a very complicated request and told me they don't take appointments which i know to be untrue. I waited for the planner (which they tried to talk me out of). The trip planner told me i needed to tell her step by step which points of interest i wanted to see on my trip while i was there to discuss which route to take and what each route offered. It was incredibly exhausting trying to navigate continuous road blocks to the service you have repeatedly expressed needing. I ultimately got the service i was requesting despite the woman telling me she doesn't \"deal in campgrounds\". Frustrated - i shouldn't have to convince service people to provide their service. Tell me how you CAN help me not how you CAN'T.",

Five stars.\n\nThe only negative? No drive thru at this branch. One star. There is, however, an ATM out front you can use if you don't mind getting out of your car.\n\nIf you're not familiar with credit unions in general, they can be a good alternative to big banks for individual consumers. They will make you open a $25 minimum savings account to become a member, kind of silly, but it's something the regulators require. They're non profit, but they still have to cover the cost of salaries, rent, computers... Still, there's a chance they may offer better deposit and loan rates than the big banks. Sometimes they're not as efficient, or lag in adoption of technology, but they usually make up for it with friendlier, less adversarial service. Not a bad trade off.",

I originally came here 8 months ago for an original car loan and was denied despite the fact I have 3 accounts here. I was told I didn't have enough \"Car Credit History\" despite the fact that I have AWESOME credit and have been doing business with these people since 2010. So I tried to be understanding because I was told to come back in 6 months and they would refinance my loan. I decided to wait for 8 months.....walked in with my even MORE AWESOME CREDIT SCORE......and 8 ON TIME payments towards my new Jeep Patriot. So after filling out the application.....running my credit and even receiving a glowing comment from the manager of this location.....I was still DENIED. Reason being is because they wanted to see a year's worth of payments toward my new Jeep......WHATTTTTTTT? It seems funny to me that I can afford to pay close to 2500 bucks for the first 8 months but I can't pay about 1200 over the next 4......hmmmm. I even have more money in my 3 accounts combined to just pay the 1200 up front if that truly was the issue. \n\nSo needless to say I was extremely disappointed and I will be closing all of my Desert Schools accounts and taking my money to a Credit Union that can ACTUALLY help me.

    "text": "I unfortunately had to bail a friend out of jail a few months ago, and it was not a pleasant experience. I called Express around midnight and the guy on the phone (forgot his name) was very helpful and accommodating. The bail was a lot more than I had anticipated, and he told me I could pay half up front and then pay the balance later. Then he told me to come on down to their office located on Charleston and Casino Center. \n\nI arrived close to 1am and filled out all of the required paperwork, then paid half of the money as was discussed. I was then told that the bail would be taken right to the jail and posted, so I would be able to pickup my friend at 9am the next morning. Since I had never done this before, I trusted him and went home assuming everything would be taken care of. \n\nWhen morning came, over 6 hours later, I called the jail to verify that the bail was posted and they told me it wasn't. I called Express right away and the same guy told me that the runner had already dropped off the money and the bail was posted. \"We have a receipt and everything.\" He told me. I figured maybe it took some time to process, so I trusted what he said. An hour later I called the jail again and was told no dice. Express still stuck with their story and I was getting nowhere, so I decided to drive down to the jail myself and find out what was going on. \n\nWhen I arrived at the jail, I was told that the runner had just gotten there, and the paperwork was not correct so the bail was not accepted. The runner was told to go back to the office and redo it. I was beside myself! They had not previously been there as I was told before, they were just now showing up after 9am. A good 8 hours since I first dropped off the money! I was pissed off and angry that I was lied to. Also the cutoff time to post bail was 8am, so my friend was not able to get out until 9pm. He had to spend an extra 12 hours in jail because of this incompetent company. \n\nI ended up calling and using another company, who posted my friends bail right away without any money up front. He was finally released after 9pm. I returned to Express the following day to pickup my money and I expressed my frustrations to the guy who was working the morning shift. He seemed genuinely concerned to hear about my situation, but there was nothing he could do at that point. If you need to bail someone out of jail, do yourself a favor and stay far away from this company.",

Hey....buying a home is stressful, but Chris, Carly, and Colleen made it a pleasure.\n\nWe received frequent email updates with figures and status updates of where our loan was in the process.  And then today I got home, still very much in the process of moving, and had just moved the pets over which can be very stressful for them and me.  And then the ding dang doorbell rings and it's some dude trying to sell me Dish TV and ADT home security.  Now, this is one enterprising young man, but I am not interested in either of those products and had to say \"No\" about 7 times before he would mosey on down the road.  \n\nI looked down and saw a UPS package by the door.

During that time he gave incorrect information to the people we were trying to purchase a house from which caused them to panic and ultimately pull of out the deal. The correct information was presented to him several times throughout the process and he just didn't seem to understand it. Granted, it was a bit of a complicated situation but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been worked out. Fabian just did seem to understand very much nor give much effort into solving the problem.

If anybody has been to downtown Phoenix during the day, they would know only people at conferences are walking around that section of town so I couldn't imagine who they would be helping.

Explained to her that several agents had told me the branch had to start this process and ask to be introduced during a transfer to someone who could help. Guess what? I was just sent to the start of the 800 menu again. Was not able to reach anybody after another 10 calls, I gave up defeated but still victorious.

    "text": "(Update: I guess I was getting too noisy, because my mortgage was dumped onto another lender so I don't have any more recourse. Do not do business with these liars and thieves.)\n\nI was offered a loan modification, were misinformed about process and our payment was increased instead of reduced. Caused us to file for bankruptcy.\n\nOne year after I bought my house, I received a notification that there was a mistake with escrow the way my mortgage was written, and that my payment was increasing by nearly $200. This was not something I was capable of doing, I signed a specific mortgage to make a specific payment. So, in 2010 I applied for and was considered for a loan modification, after signing on with a third party agent who failed to perform any of his duties and forced us to file a lawsuit, we contacted BofA directly who finally claimed to get the unfinished paperwork processed and started the modification process.\n\nThe first packet we receive for our three month \"trial\" period stated a new payment that was an INCREASE of approximately $300. I called specifically about this and arranged an in-person meeting with one of their loan modification specialists at one of their corporate centers in my home city of Phoenix. I was assured every time that this increase in payment would not be permanent and it was a direct result of being behind on my payments. I reluctantly accepted this, and forced my way through the further burden on my finances. \n\nAfter my three month trial period, I received my final paperwork. Contrary to everything I was assured by every level of employee at Bank of America I could contact, the $300 increase was, in fact, permanent. Managers I contacted to complain behaved as if they were doing me a favor because despite the $300 increase, the months I was behind were being forgiven.\n\nSo, they were basically telling me I could accept the new payment and be forced to file for bankruptcy, or deny the new payment program and face foreclosure instead.\n\nIn doing this, Bank of America caused me to file for Bankruptcy in order to keep my house. And were thoroughly unapologetic and unwilling to correct this injustice.\n\nIt has been over a year now, and we have just completed our Bankruptcy and had the case closed. What do I receive in the mail? A statement from Bank of America saying I owe late fees on my mortgage payment (approximately $250) that they refuse to correct, which was a direct result of removing our mortgage from their Bankruptcy department and failing to inform us of doing so. Then, I was sent (via overnight FedEx) a packet that they claimed I requested for a Loan Modification.\n\nWhen we called to complain, we were told that this was just \"mass mail\". Not only is overnight FedEx not mass mail and clearly a lie, their records should show more than clearly that I had been thoroughly through a \"Loan Modification\" program with them previously. This is a gross misappropriation of funds and just further evidence of their negligence and abuse toward their customers.\n\nA letter of complaint was written onto their Facebook page. It was deleted with no response. Bank of America agents are unwilling to correct their own errors and rectify the abuse I have suffered by their actions. I have been mistreated time and time again by this organization and they do not care. I have finally had enough. I can provide any paperwork necessary to substantiate my claims, but it is nothing that Bank of America does not have on record.\n\nWe have filed a complaint with the BBB (CASE#: 438356), and will continue to complain to every organization we can until this is rectified. I have been abused by this organization quite enough, thank you very much.",

I received a letter on 9-12-2016 stating that the rebate was rejected for being outside (after) the promotion date. The promotion date was 7-1-2016, I purchased it on 7-1-2016, the rebate paperwork from Newegg says 7-1-2016. So, I called the 1-800 number to find out what was wrong. I spoke with Megan at Velocity who said that her screen showed 7-2-2016 was the valid date for the promotion. I told her I had the paperwork from Newegg in front of me saying otherwise. She said I could fax in my information or re submit by mail. I asked if I could scan and email, but she said no they wouldn't accept emails. Seriously.....let's step back in time here and use an antiquated device that most people don't have access too. It is so frustrating dealing with companies that don't honor rebates and make up excuses so they don't have to pay them out. I'm not sure why NEWEGG would choose to be associated with them. NEWEGG please help me understand this?",

When I called, they told me I had purchased the product AFTER the promotion ended. After hours of looking for the original receipt, I had proof I purchased it within the correct time period. I called them back and now have to send a fax to them and call them back again so they can reprocess the request. \nThis is a complete scam. I believe this rebate company is making up lies in hopes that people lost their receipts, or plain forgot to call back regarding the rebates. Then this Velocity Fulfillment company receives the rebates and cashes them in or something for their own good or receives kickbacks from the manufacturers for purposely loosing or misfiling customers paperwork. \nIf you have invested in this company, back out now before the Better Business Bureau or Television Networks investigates them for fraud. I guarantee this irresponsible handling of customers will not be dismissed. \nOnly reason I give it 2 stars is because the lady on the customer service line when I called was extremely polite and respectful and gave me all the information I requested.",

The tellers were friendly and efficient, but when transactions mattered the most, I give them \"F\". My savings and checking accounts were linked from the beginning. When I requested a transfer from another financial institution from my savings account and the funds were in checking, Credit Union 1 RETURNED the transfer for NSF. (I have NEVER had a NSF check previously at any banking institution!) Then, they transferred funds from checking to cover the $29 NSF charge. I was charged $25 from the other financial institution for a total of $54 when the money was in the bank with linked accounts. When I called and received yet another manager, he used a lame excuse that transfers only work from savings to checking, not checking to savings. He refused to provide a refund for the NSF charge even when I explained I would close my account if he did not refund the NSF charge.  He chose to close both my accounts rather than be professional and fair.  I would NEVER recommend this savings account to anyone!!!",

A very long time customer.\n\nI have also, for the most part been a happy customer - until recently.\n\nMy niece took a Chase money order that I gave her down to cash it at the this branch, the branch I purchased the money order from.  They would not cash it.  Though she had two pieces of ID and I even called and told them that she was my niece  - I was told in no uncertain terms that her state issued drivers license had a number that was not clear and therefore they would not cash it.\n\nShe went two blocks down and cashed the money order.  Last I recalled money orders were like cash and she presented what they asked for.  Worst I think for me, was that the person I spoke to had zero interest in what I had to say.  She was short, to the point and cared not whether I continued to bank with them or not.\n\nThat was two days ago. Today I called to verify that a cashiers check that I had purchased at Chase had indeed been cashed.  When I called the 800 number I was treated as I had become accustom to being treated by Chase.  The home office folks did all they could do but told me that I had to call the branch I actually got the cashiers check from, lucky me, the Peoria branch.\n\nAnd guess what, when I called they listened..then the person who answered the phone said \"You do know it's 4:45 and we close at 5:00... I am with a customer at the moment (they answer the phone while they are with a customer??) so she proceeds to say... I will have to take your name and number and someone will call you back.\n\nDo you know... she only asked for my first name and when I asked her to repeat  my number she said \"no I got it\" and hung up.\n\nI do not know what is going on with this branch or chase as a whole but it is pretty disappointing as I have been one of those customers that frequently recommends them.  In fact, I hold a position in a very large company with thousands of employee's.  We are a company who requires direct deposit and I use to encourage my employees to use chase.\n\nThat will no longer be my recommendation.  I train folks on customer service and it only takes a few bad experiences to change an entire companies reputation.  This branch is putting it all on the line for Chase in my opinion.\n\nI have not changed banks yet, but I have definitely changed branches.",

I have been her customer for years so I have known her staff by name over that time. If that alone doesn't tell you to stay away, let me do it for you...\n\nWhen Jen first opened up she was the ONLY State Farm agent near the new Mountains Edge area. This is why she grew so quickly, not because of great service. However, now that she has grown so quickly she doesn't have time for her clients and leaves you to her untrained short-tenured staff, who give you wrong information most of the time, incorrectly code your policies so that you are paying MORE than if they did it correctly (which I believe is intentional since they're commission based), and don't give you the time of day unless you are adding a policy. I have easily paid over $1000 over time because of their incompetent staff/lack of attention. For example, not putting multi car/accident free/multi line discounts/ etc even after you notice and ask them about it only to find later they lied to you and it was never added. \n\nDon't get me wrong- if you are trying to create a policy they will be all over you. They'll call you 2-3 times a day to make sure they get the sale. But as soon as they get it, along with that commission, you will just be another number to them and won't get an ounce of service in return when you actually need it once in a blue moon. You will have to call repeatedly and beg someone to call you back. Meanwhile, her staff don't stick around all that long and you will be working with another new face before you know it... and all of them are young and active on social media... and they will continue finding ways to get Jen 5 stars here and there.\n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt for years until I finally had enough. Oh, and the 3 people I have referred feel the same way. There are a million other state farm agents out there that would love to have your business and treat you like a customer rather than a commission check. If there were a 0 star rating I would definitely use it.\n\n\nUPDATE: After 2 weeks of practically begging this office to transfer my policies to a different agent I finally got fed up and contacted the corporate office to make it happen without their 'assistance'.\n\nTransferring your policies AWAY from an agent is an extremely easy process. I wish I did it sooner and It took me less than 5 minutes.",

I called around and when I called this office, I spoke with Ashley. They do bundle policies and she didn't give me the cheapest quote, but she was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I told her I was still calling around for quotes so I'd let her know. In the mean time while calling other companies, she called me back with an even lower rate, saving me $100 dollars a month over my current policy. So we decided to go with them. We went in to fill out our paperwork. Ashley was so friendly and it didn't take us long at all to get everything done. We ended up with renters insurance, 2 life insurance policies and full coverage auto insurance for $100 less per month. I would recommend this office to anyone needing any insurance coverage. They work hard to get you a good rate & exactly the coverage you need.  Thanks Ashley! You're awesome!",

Having been with Allstate for over 10 years, I wasn't really wanting to change companies.  Then I met Jen and some of her other agents. I immediately felt like I was in good hands and that I could go to them with all of my insurance, as well as other financial business as well.  Since 2011, we have our mortgage insurance, 3 vehicles  (2 of which are brand new) and I recently rolled over my Roth IRA with them as well.  I am strongly considering opening a bank account with them as well as a line of credit.  One stop shopping within walking distance!  Can't beat that!  But more importantly, it is so nice to walk in and always feel so welcome.  Oh! And we pay under $300 a month for everything.

Each month we were the ones trying to figure out why our monthly premium was always changing and doing higher and higher only to be given the run around. Like any agent who's trying trying to get business, they start out pleasant and friendly hoping to get your money and even go as far as providing you with their business card and says \"call me\" if you have questions. Well, that friendly service goes out the window once you become there customer. When you try to call your agent/owner of that office, she never calls back, and when you call the office, she's always too busy and will call you when SHE has time. Sorry to say I'd rather pay a little more for better service somewhere else. I will never go back to this office.",

Every time you have question or concerns they keep you on hold for a very long time  or respond to you saying they will call back and never call back. They raise your insurance and claim that they raised it on all cars that are a specific model. When I finally decided to cancel they told me that if I cancelled before a specific date I wouldn't be charged for one of my cars and they would prorate the bill and refund me the rest. When I called them week later letting them know I haven't received anything they told me they would call me back letting me know what was going on and never did . My husband and I called several time and every time they gave us the same response that we should be getting a check of $300+ in the mail in the following week. The check I received was $15 and when I called to speak with the manager she rudely just told me that's that was the amount . When I asked for the break down or a number to contact billing she responded that they were closed. I told her I would call the next business day and she responded with that billing was only internal. I don't understand how several workers repeatedly told me I would receive a certain amount and then the manager just comes out with some bullshit like that.",

Meanwhile, we are sleeping on a mattress on the floor, have no winter clothes, the family Thanksgiving will be spent at a hotel. We have to shut down the Pods, movers, appliance delivery for the 4th time tomorrow. (with NO date to close)\nI can't say I would ever recommend this company- and my husband and I are both in the Business. I've never experienced such poor communication and unkept goals.  They should have been more upfront with us. Some employees are nice, but their hands are tied so it does not help us. We were so loyal to THEM that we bypassed the builders lender and $2000 credit because we felt they had worked and deserved to be paid. Now we're getting the shaft. Beware, and get personal references in this industry. \nSadly, the Chapman's",

The Team at Alderus is very responsive, and works for their client. We had a very complicated situation with moving cross country and trying to get financed with income that was not continuous. We had essentially given up when Julie came up with a clever solution which worked and stayed very close to our timeline. Overall, so happy with the final outcome. Will continue to work with Julie and Team Alderus in the future (as long as Julie is there!)",

    "text": "Absolute joke. I recently opened a small business (no employees) and when I called to inquire about whether they had options for me (I already had my personal accounts with them), I got a snotty person saying they didn't really cater to small businesses and that there weren't any benefits to me available. She had such an attitude. I finally decided to stop into the Northside branch and ask about this. We opened my business account with almost no problems. Annoying little glitches everywhere, though. Everyone just seemed to fumble. I have been having a mediocre experience until this last week. \n\nBeing that I am a small business owner, I occasionally receive personal checks. I deposit them with mobile banking no problem. Suddenly, with NO explanation at all, the mobile deposit feature is gone. I call and find out that because my personal account had some overdrafts in the past (stupid Paypal ACH thing ughhhh) this feature was taken away from me as punishment. It's six overdrafts in a YEAR. ONE YEAR. It's not like I wrote bad checks (never once) or had a mobile deposit that bounced (NEVER). Mind you they collected $180 in overdraft fees from me, AND I corrected the account within hours as I have money in my other accounts. So let's get this straight: You overdraw, they take away your ability to deposit. That's right. YOU WILL BE PUNISHED. It's like some mean old lady taking away your Halloween candy because you got sick on one piece. \n\nI received no notice of this. I just opened my business the 1st of September. I'm still trying to find my footing and am just coming out of poverty. My business is profitable and has had no issues. I can no longer mobile deposit to my business account, even though it  has nothing to do with my personal accounts. I will admit, I threw quite the colossal fit over the phone. The man I talked to talked to someone in account management  (FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES while I was on hold) and told me that that ONE person had decided that they didn't want to reverse the decision. So one person has all the power to make my life a huge pain because...oh say... he/she had indigestion or a fight with their partner. \n\nI expressed that I would be closing all of my accounts (including a loan) and moving elsewhere. No one cared at all. I will be switching to another financial institution tomorrow. I need to get away from this completely backwards credit union. You've been warned.",

I moved, and called to give them a change of address. I also sent them the change of address several times. My loan payments finally arrived, and I paid them promptly and usually double- so I could finish paying off the car early. Finally, I decided to pay off everything I owed in one lump sum. I sent them the check for the remainder of the payment, and never heard from them again, which I thought was odd at the time.\n\nLittle did I know- that they reported me to the credit reporting bureau for default of my car loan! WTF? I called to ask what this was all about, and they said that I had made a mistake on my check ( written amount didn't match the number amount) so they didn't apply my payment. They sent a notice to the OLD address, and when I didn't respond, promptly reported me to the credit reporting agency!! They never apologized for the mistake, never made things right with the reporting agency, and it is the ONLY black mark on my report- all because of THEIR mistake!!!\n\nTake my advice- stay far, far away!!",

Amanda and Sam were very kind, professional, and were sure to make my experience a personal one.\n\nThe other day I was on the bus on my way to work and heard a man in front of me calling his insurance company to replace his windshield that was cracked in one of the recent dust storm (I don't really like that trendy H-word for dust storm, so I'm not going to use it).  Well, needless to say, he had one of those \"we have the cheapest rates\" insurance and as it turns out, the windshield wasn't covered and he got upset with the person on the phone.  \n\nWhat did we learn from this?\n1 - Just in case you forgot, the expression ' you get what you pay for\" is 100% accurate.\n2 - Also, don't have long, extended, personal conversations on a bus.

    "text": "This guy is the biggest waste of human flesh in the insurance world. I make a late payment on the 11th thinking \"Whew got it in before the cancellation date\" They take my payment which even thought its late is still within the date given to pay it. My bank statement says right on it that they charged my card on the 11th.  I find out my policy is cancelled on the 13th so I call the customer service number and the lady on the end of the line tells me Ive been driving uninsured for two days since they cancelled me on the 11th.  She then informs me she can do nothing for me and keeps telling me I have to see my agent (whats the point of customer service if they cant do anything without sending you right back to the agents?) and I will have to wait for Rick to waddle his ass back into his office on Monday before I can be reinstated which is two more days. I call Rick and leave a message that I want my payment refunded and to cancel my insurance. I get a snarky response back that he agrees I should go to another agency, I reply I have switched to Geico and want my policy cancelled. He writes back \"Gladly!\" and then sends me another email telling me it will take a month to cancel me so I don't get any of my last payment refunded and I had to contact customer service to tell them not to take the next payment out. They say they will refer my inquiry to my agent, which is the completely worthless guy who cant seem to figure out how to cancel my policy like hes asked in the first place. Right now I'm paying car insurance to two companies because one of them cant get their head out of their ass.",

I asked him why he did that and he said that he thought they would be quicker. I told him that was poor customer service and he refused to apologize. What a jerk!\nThen, as it turns out, he also failed to do his job and complete the tasks he told me he did.

Husband had chemotherapy this afternoon and is in no shape to change a battery. Battery is DEAD and needs to be replaced. Guess what, they don't have a battery to replace this one. Not that they don't have one on their truck, they don't have one in stock. The girl I spoke to on the phone, offered to tow our truck. Tow it where? It's at home in our garage! Does thus make any sense at all? Her only offer was \" let us tow you\" we couldn't get it they her head we did not need a tow, we need a battery. Canceling this worthless $200.00( ish) a year service. Service for what? \n\nI would like to update this review in all fairness. I received a phone call from AAA a few days later as I also wrote to them describing the above incident. Krista left 2 messages and apologized for what happened and went above and beyond in compensation. I can only assume the rep we spoke with initially was not familiar with what batteries fit which commonly USA made trucks!  Nevertheless, I feel AAA handled the complaint fairly and wanted all to know this must have been a blip that won't occur again. I change my ***** rating:)",

They also changed my brake fluid, refilled my windshield wiper fluid, filled my oil with a \"special oil\" that gets me better gas mileage AND filled all four tires with air. ALL of this was FREE. \n\nthey're a family business and truly believe in great customer service. Will definitely be going back in the future.",

    "text": "I was on my way back to Cali from Vegas one late Sunday night when my car broke down by the Primm Valley Resort and Casino. Turned out my alternator needed to be replaced. I had no choice but to call out from work the next day and get it fixed. I did not know of any auto shops around the area and there was no way I was gonna tow my car back to Cali. I decided to yelp auto shops and this was the first one that came up. I called first thing in the morning and a woman by the name Mary picked up the phone.(Turns out she is one of the owners) She was awesome and very helpful from the start! I explained my situation and told her I needed to get back to Cali that same day. She told me to just bring the car in and they will have it taken care of right away. I got my car towed into the shop and the moment I walked in, there was Mary at the front desk. I could tell it was her by the sound of her voice and how sweet and polite she was. She started working on things right away and even introduce me to the mechanic that would be working on my car. I've never gotten service like that! Anyways, to make a long story short, I found out I had a warranty on my alternator (I had gotten it replaced over a year ago and bought the part from Autozone). The mechanic then went out of his way and went to the local Autozone to have the part replaced! They could have  just left that work up to me or could have just charged me to replace it with their own parts but they didn't. They went above and beyond with their service! I was very pleased with the service that was provided!!    Everything was taken care of like she said. I definitely recommend this place! I wasn't ripped off like other places. You can definitely trust this place. :) Thanks Mary!",

Needless to say, brake failure is a scary thing, so the next morning I dropped my ride off at Professional Brake Service to have 'em check it out.\n\nMary, who remembered my name from my earlier phone call (nice touch), called my about an hour later and actually apologized because there was nothing they could sell me. My brakes were at 90% and she said they couldn't duplicate the problem and the car stopped on a dime. She mentioned that some cars acted this way occasionally in this heat.\n\nNot only wouldn't they rip me off, they also corrected my tire placement that the last shop I visited screwed up (high end wheels that have to be on a specific side of the car). They even reset my check engine light!\n\nLet me tell you, there is no better feeling than to walk out of a garage not feeling like you've been **you know what**. \n\nGive these people your business!",

My mom taught me that mechanics see a woman walk through the door, and they know that they can jack up the price.  So far, this has pretty much been true for me.\n\nBUT, I saw the amazing reviews here on Yelp, and I thought, \"Maybe.\"  A dealership told me that my front brakes were at 20% and definitely needed to be changed ASAP, but I didn't believe them (see explanation above) and had been driving around with increasingly squeaky brakes for a year.\n\nWhen I called this place, Jeff (the owner) was SUPER friendly and he fit me in that day.  I got there, and we had a good time talking and laughing, and I just had a good feeling about these people.  Turns out, the dealership totally lied to me, and my front brakes were at 55%.  Professional Brake Service cleaned up my pads, sprayed some stuff on them to prevent squeaking, and told me to come back in a year.  After being straight up lied to at the other place, this was totally refreshing!  An honest mechanic?  Whaaaat?\n\nI will absolutely be back when my brakes need to be changed or fixed.

    "text": "I want to tell anybody reading this a story; a true story that sounds so much like a fairy tale I should begin it with \"Once upon a time.......\".\n\nLike many people, I always research the source for repairs of any kind and to anything, I own on the web.  Having done the due diligence I found Pro Brakes, which coincidentally is just a short drive from my home.  Since I own an Acura TL which is now out of factory warranty, I know it can be pretty expensive to fix.  The great news it has NEVER failed me.  But even though it has been very reliable, scheduled maintenance is still pretty costly.  Since I don't recall ever having replaced the brakes, I took it to Pro Brakes at the mileage when the owners manual says replace the breaks.  I did this, having first stopped at the ATM for some ammo and 7/11 for snacks and magazines.   Expecting the be there for at least an hour and expecting to spend about $400, I was barely into the first story in Sports Illustrated about the USC Trojans new QB when the owner broke the news to me, \"this car doesn't need brakes; not even close.  I mean I can change them if you insist, but you still have 30% on the front and more like 40% on the rear.  You are good to go\".\n\nStill shocked weeks later I felt compelled to write this review.  These folks are honest beyond definition.  They very easily could have done the brake job, charged me the quoted $400 price, and still retained me as a customer.  But now I am extremely confident in both the Acura TL I chose to buy, and Pro Brakes as the source for everything regarding the maintenance to keep it running, hopefully, for a long time.  We've recently replaced my wife's car because it began costing a fortune to maintain as soon as it was paid off; it was an Audi A4 which still appeared as nice as the day we bought it.  But literally every other month something broke or a light cam on.  When that happens in an Audi A4 you are pretty much forced to begin researching your next ride, because when an Audi starts acting stupid (even with impeccable maintenance records to prove EVERY scheduled service was performed), every time something requires a trip to the mechanic its $1,000.  Now, to be honest, I had not discovered Pro Brakes for the Audi issues.  European Motor Cars was where that hunk of junk went for service; and they, in my opinion, did more damage to that car than good, while still averaging $975 per issue.  That is another story for another day.  So we ridded our lives of 2 cancers at one time by trading in the Audi for a 2015 Subaru Outback and then we could jettison EMC along with it.  \n\nPro Brakes may have odd hours (being closed on Sat and Sun), but their work and fair pricing makes getting to them and using their services worth the extra effort.  We highly recommend this company and will continue to use them for any services we need.  Hopefully you will be as please with their service, conduct, honestly, pricing, and integrity as we are.",

    "text": "I've been to the Professional Brake Service twice, mainly because of all the positive yelp reviews. Jeff, the proprietor, is very friendly and it's a family run business. \n\nI went to Tire Works a few days ago for a routine oil change. I mentioned that my brakes squeak when I go in reverse. They said they would examine the car and came back with a $407 estimate (after some coupon that was only good for that day). They claimed that my front rotors were hotspotted and needed replacing (which means that the pads needed to be replaced as well) and that the back rotors needed to be surface cut. Both front and back brake pads were 6mm (at 40%). I called my husband and he wanted a second opinion.\n\nSo a few days later, I went to the Professional Brake Service. I've been there before when my service light came on (which turned out to be a light notifying you of the next oil change). They turned off the light for free. I told Jeff what Tire Works had reported in their estimate. Jeff had his technicians look at the car and had me look at the rotors. They were perfectly fine on both the front and rear tires. He pointed out that the front brake pads were at 85% and the back ones were at 60%. He said all I needed was to have the rotors sprayed with lubricant and he didn't charge me a cent. I tipped his men $20 just because they were so honest. \n\nIf you need any brake work done or need auto service, visit Jeff at the Professional Brake Service. If they can not do your repairs, they will give you a reasonably-priced, good referral. This is definitely the most honest auto place I've ever been to!",

These guys, that's who!\n\nI was nursing my rear brakes for a few thousand more miles after Craig worked some magic on them the last time.  You see, he wasn't able to change the pads because Audi decided to be really fancy and implemented an electronic parking brake. That's cool and all but it also means a special tool connected to the computer is required any time you change the rear brakes.  Good way to ensure you keep coming back to the dealer. Not so fast!  I got a message from the owner, Jeff, letting me know he got the tool and was ready for me when I came back in.\n\nWell wouldn't you know it, I was ready. So, a quick call to Jeff and I had the parts ordered for me and ready for my visit on Monday. I showed up at 10:30AM...and was on my way with new rear brakes by high noon. 1.5 hours to change just rear brakes you ask? Ok ok...30 minutes of that was me poking around and chatting in the back with the techs. Yes, unlike some places, you are allowed to be involved in the process while your car is being worked on.  I used to do all this stuff myself; now I have neither the space nor the time for all of that. I'm glad I found these guys a few years ago (via other Yelp reviews). Seriously, if you need your car fixed up...head on down to these guys. Tired of the chain scams, BS they feed you and the tech school dropouts they employee? Head on down here and let the pros take care of you. \n\nMary, Jeff, Craig and the rest of the crew: keep up the great work!",

Professional Brake Service is close to my house, so I dropped in based on the recommendations of other Yelpers.\n\nAfter inspecting the brakes, they called to recommend replacing the well-worn rotors and cheapie brake pads I had just installed.  Certainly legitimate issues, but I didn't have enough money to cover it.  Jeff did the best he could based upon what I could afford.\n\nI thought the communication was good and I appreciated Jeff's efforts to help me get the most braking value out of my limited budget.  I left perfectly satisfied that day.\n\nAnyway, their customer service shined brightest a few weeks later.  I went to take off a wheel to rotate my tires and found that one of the lug nuts had been cross-threaded.  Believe me, these things happen to everyone.  I called Pro Brake and JD explained that they would be happy to fix it, but they were heavily booked that Friday.  JD asked if I could come in Monday, and not only would they fix the lug, but they would also rotate my tires for me.  Unfortunately that didn't fit my schedule.\n\nJeff, the owner, agreed to squeeze me in.  I took the truck and even though their lifts were full of cars, JD worked on my truck behind the shop right away.  I have to tell you, replacing the stud is harder than you'd think on my truck, requiring disassembly of the whole wheel down to the bearings..  JD spent an hour on the job.  They even tried to order a genuine Nissan lug nut to replace the one that was damaged.  Unfortunately, it wasn't in stock, so they found a serviceable replacement in the shop.\n\nEvery business can be pleasant when they're taking your money, but their true colors come through in a situation like this.  They cheerfully owned up to the problem and did everything reasonable to see that I was satisfied.  Trust me, some other places forget you as fast as they can process your payment.\n\nThanks Jeff and JD.  I appreciated your efforts and your honesty.  Professional Brake Service is my go-to from now on.",

I thought I would need a whole new A/C compressor, but it turned out to be a small part that was more than affordable.  The owner and the service guy told me what was going on and how much it was going to cost as they fixed my car (instead of waiting till the end).\n\nI am so grateful they didn't take advantage of me because this was the first time I ever got my car fixed.  The owner really does value repeat service and referrals over a quick buck and I really appreciate it. The owner is super friendly (and funny) and the service was more than quick!

However, to be on the safe side, I wanted to get a second opinion. Professional Brake Service has amazing reviews on Google and Yelp, so I came in to see if I really did need brakes.\n\nMary, one of the owners, was working the front desk. She was very welcoming and friendly, making sure I got the best service possible. After the technicians looked at my brakes, she informed me that my front disc brakes were far from needing to be changed, and my rear drum brakes were still about a year from needing it. While most places would have no problem selling me services I didn't need, this place was honest.\n\nShe did recommend getting an adjustment. I had a coupon that I printed from their website, so the price was very affordable. On top of that, future adjustments are free, so I can come in every 3-6 months and not have to pay again. Free is always a good thing.\n\nIf you have any brake needs for you car, come here. Quality workmanship, great service, friendly, and honest. Can't ask for more.",

I took my car there after being told by my previous mechanic that I would need rear brakes in three months. I took my car there and dropped it off expecting to have to have them replaced. After about 20 minutes the owner called and said my brakes didn't need to be replaced, just cleaned. Instead of the $300 I was expecting it cost me $59 and was ready in an hour. I was so pleased that I took my other car down to have it checked because the check engine light was on. They did a diagnostic check and determined that it was because I hadn't tightened my gas cap enough. They reset the system and sent me on my way free of charge. I have sent several people there and they have been equally pleased. I have definitely found my new mechanic.",

I just picked up my car this morning after giving them a laundry list of services that my car needed and that I had been procrastinating about fixing. Lets just say that, after 7 years in this city I have FINALLY found a shop I can bring my car to and feel good about!\n\nThe shop is owned by Jeff and Mary. I just met Jeff this morning after talking to him on the phone several times. I mostly dealt with Mary, and you would be hard pressed to find two friendlier and more down to earth people in the city. They were so rediculously friendly, helpful, and informative.\n\nI did my homework and have a friend that works at a dealership and their prices are very fair and very reasonable! They always went out of their way to be as accomodating and helpful as humanly possible. I have a co-worker who went to them last year and had nothing but good things to say about his experience there as well.\n\n I cannot recommend this place highly enough! After so many bad experiences at different shops around the city, it feels so good to have found a place where you can take your car and not only not feel like you are not being ripped off, but that you are in good hands with good people. \n\n\n\nYou owe it to yourself to check this place out! \n\n\n5 huge stars!",

This place definitely deserves the 5 stars for their friendly, professional, honest and prompt service. \n\nI am a car newbie and really don't know a whole lot about cars. I heard a light squeal in my brakes and thought I would need new brakes or something. I first went to a dealership and they informed me that I did need new brakes and that it would be around $250 with labor to have the front brakes replaced. I scoffed at the idea that brakes would cost so much, and as a comparison shopper I decided to go to a third party and see what they had to say. To me I always shop 2-3 places before I make my decision. It is like going to a doctor's office and having them tell you that you have cancer. Get a second opinion! \n\nI decided on this business since I heard some positive things online and they had a coupon for brake service with free inspection. I walked in and was greeted by Jeff the owner who was very professional and courteous. He asked the standard questions and then lifted my car to check if I needed new brakes. \n\nHe informed me that I in fact did not need new brakes and they were perfectly fine and that the squeal could just be the dust. He adjusted the brakes and sprayed them down and filled up my brake fluid. He walked me through and showed me my brake pads and invited me to stay at the lift to watch the mechanic do his work. I happily agreed as I am always looking for any opportunity to learn. \n\nI was in and out of the place in about 30 minutes. I would highly recommend them for your brake service.

    "text": "I drive a 2006 Toyota Corolla with about 150,000 miles on it.  It's been shaking/vibrating like crazy for probably about the last 8 months or so every time I step on the brakes.  But I kept putting off bringing it in because I was scared to death of how much the repairs would cost and because I absolutely HATE going to mechanics (hubby never has time to do it since he's a pilot and out of town most days).  But finally the car was making enough noise that the fear of dying in a crash outweighed the other fears and we decided it was time.  Hubby did some looking around at reviews and picked Professional Brake Service after seeing the great reviews it had here.  \n\nI have to say we absolutely made the right choice and I can't recommend this spot enough if you need brake service.  They were very warm and friendly from the time I called to make the appointment to the time I picked up the car to go home.  I have one small complaint but it's a typical mechanic issue, let me explained what happened.  I dropped the car off, telling them what it was doing and pretty much expecting the worst.  About 2 hours later, the owner (Jeff) called me to give me the details, he said I had 2 options.  The rear brakes were fine and didn't need anything.  But the front brakes were about 80-90% worn and really needed to be replaced.  He said he could do the whole thing, including using \"premium rotors\" that are \"powder covered\", and it would cost $497.  After I recovered from almost dropping the phone, I said the car is a 2006 and we probably won't keep it much longer, it doesn't need premium anything.  He said ok, that our second option was to go with the non-premium rotor package and replace the whole thing for $397.  I said ok, let me call my husband and relay the info to him and I'll call you right back - I've learned the hard way never to just say ok, go for it!  \n\nSo I got my husband on the phone and he immediately sounded confused and a little unhappy.  He knows a lot about cars and car parts (he's the one who fixed the rear brakes) and he said $397 sounds like too much for just front brakes.  So he called Jeff himself to talk about exactly what that included.  Apparently, it included new everything including calipers and rotors (and the pads and other parts) - but my car's calipers were fine and didn't need to be replaced and the rotors weren't in great shape but could be saved for at least a couple more months by being \"machined\".  I am not at all mechanically inclined but I think my husband also said Jeff wanted to use very expensive pads that were unnecessary when the cheaper ones would be just fine for this car.  So after his conversation with Jeff, Hubby called me back and said he gave him the go-ahead but it's going to only cost $250.  I know this is partly my own fault for knowing so little about cars and brakes but this really does bug me.  I would never have even though to ask if my calipers needed to be replaced - if you tell me you're replacing them, I'm assuming it's because they need to be.  I wouldn't know to ask what kind of pads they were using.  It really feels like just another way for a mechanic to take advantage of a woman (or any uninformed customer for that matter).  I would have had to pay the $400 and never known the difference - and I sure as hel* don't have that extra money laying around!  \n\nAnyway, aside from that, they did a great job.  The car really drives like it's brand new again.  The brakes don't make a peep and they respond quickly and easily just like they're supposed to.  Since the quality of the work is what matters most to me, that's why I'm giving them 4 stars despite the above issue.  Also, like I said, everyone was very friendly and kind  and helpful for the entire process.  They had the car done and ready to go within a few hours, as promised.  And it's the owner Jeff who is there doing a lot of the talking and I like that about a business - and he's a very nice man who takes his time explaining things to you.  It's very obvious that he really cares about his business and his customers - rare find these days!  I very much wish they did everything and not just focused on brakes because I would go back but they don't at the moment.  But if you are looking for a brake place, please give this place a try, you really won't regret it!",

Normally, I don't have to deal with the customer service, but now that I have, the service is terrible.\n2 days ago, they debited over $450 from my regular checking account without my authorization.  I have contacted them 4 times now, via phone, email, and fax, and no one will return my calls or explain why that amount was debited.   I am lucky that I had enough balance in there to not go negative.\n\nWhy are they taking money out of my bank checking account?  Why won't they refund the money or at least explain their actions?  I don't know.  Whenever I call customer service they say that the accounting department will look into it.   I asked to speak to a manager, and they said that they were all in a meeting. Right.  A manager was supposed to call me back within an hour, but they never did.\n\nAlso, I have paid my yearly fee, with a check which they cashed, so I have no clue why they feel justified with debiting my account and holding the funds.  What gives them the right to steal money from my bank account?\nThe worst part is, the bank won't deal with them until the funds clear, so now, I have days (and who knows how long) until the funds are released.\n\nMy advice, if you are thinking of opening a self-directed IRA:  look somewhere else.\n\nUpdate:  Now, on the 3rd day after not hearing back from them with 4 inquiries, I call again and one of the service reps admitted that there was a computer error on their end and they were putting the money back into my account.  The only problem is:  they said it would take 7-10 business days!! So now we are pushing 2 weeks of them holding my funds in my checking account due to an error on their end.  They refuse to overnight a check, they refuse to refund any maintenance fees.  They seem to really care less.  I will be moving this account ASAP.",

Couple of years ago there was fraud and embezzlement in that company, it was taken over by government and our accounts (along with 5000 other accounts) were transferred to ETC after losing 10% of the assets to fraud. So I lost $15,000 of the cash balance and few hundreds lost out of my son's account. Back in Sept 2015, I filed ETC forms to transfer and close out our accounts out of ETC to a local IRA company in California. Apparently there was an 'asset'  left in my son's account, it being an IOU from law suit against APS. So few weeks ago in early May 2016 I found out I can get that IOU portion out of ETC also, don't have to leave it there until it settles. ETC wants to charge me $230 to close that account lol OMG, after being victimized by $15,0000 and being forced to ETC as part of the government deal, ETC wants a piece of me to close my account there. Unbelievable. I spent so much time explaining this to their customer service and all to deaf ears. If I have to, I will escalate this matter to ETC chairman Robert Desich to expose how bad they are handling my account closure. I left a voicemail today for their VP of Marketing Michelle Lee.

    "text": "I rarely take the time to write Yelp reviews, but in this case I feel like I need to so I can hopefully warn other people away from this company.\n\nThey offer self-directed IRA and 401K services ( as you probably know if you are reading this review ) but they are absolutely terrible! Among the things I can't stand:\n\n- None of the staff that I've talked to there (about eight people now) seems to care, including two who were supposedly in management. They almost never call or email you back; you have to call 2-3 times to get an answer to a question. Answers are frequently different between reps (e.g. one rep said my plan had its own FEIN (tax ID) number; the next one said it didn't. Neither could tell me what the FEIN number actually was due to 'confidentiality' reasons... even though it was MY plan. )\n\n- It took me almost six months of effort to cancel my account with them, while they continuing racking up custodial fees ( which they'll take directly out of your account with them ). For the first three months, I couldn't get answers to my question about what paperwork they needed to close the account, what needed to be notarized, etc. Once I finally got the paperwork, they claimed there was a mandatory 60 day waiting period before the account could be closed. Once that finally expired, there was it took an additional three weeks and lots of phone calls/emails for them to wire my money to me, even though they said they'd do it the day the plan closed.\n\n- Plan administration is done by ExpertPlan, a third party. They'll regularly say 'oh that's ExpertPlan's problem'. You'll call ExpertPlan, and they'll say 'that's Equity Trust's problem'.  I think I know how little kids feel when Dad says 'go talk to Mom' and Mom says 'go talk to Dad'.\n\n- They have an internal brokerage ( Mid Ohio Securities ) which lets you invest in stocks, etc... However, it doesn't talk to the IRA/401K side. In my case, I had to transfer money from the brokerage to the 401K side, which meant I had to call the brokerage 800 number separately ( the 401K rep couldn't connect me or request the transfer from her own company ). After that, they lost the money... brokerage division said they'd sent it, and 401K division said they didn't have it. It went on that way for several days, with multiple calls and emails from me, until 401K finally figured out they had received it but mis-coded it, and it just hadn't been put in my account. I requested several times that they talk to each other to figure out what happened ( after all, both divisions are in the same physical building in Ohio ) but no one on either side wanted to take the initiative to help out.\n\nAnd last but not least, the fees between ExpertPlan and Equity Trust are very high. For example, my termination fees:\n- $200 ETC termination fee\n- $700 ExpertPlan termination fee ( which they reduced to $400 )\n- $400 'Asset Re-registration' Fee\n\nSo that's $1300 (reduced to $1000) for simply closing the account! Other fees are equally high.\n\nI would stay away, and find a small/local firm to help you if possible.",

I remember the sheets of paper reams with the perforated sides you have to tear off that they used for receipts. \n\nThis place was also where I got my first credit card. And first car loan. Then my 2nd. Then it was the first time I paid off the car too. Now they financed my first cab for my taxi business. So yeah lots of fond memories. \n\nThis branch is very convenient and centrally located in Tempe. The staff here are really friendly, and if you go in a few times they will probably start knowing or name, or least stop asking for your ID for every transaction. \n\nTSCU as a whole is a great financial institution. I don't pay checking fees. They have been good about waiving any overdraft fees. They always have great rates. \n\nTheir website, although not the prettiest gets the job done and I never have any problem doing what I want to do. In fact I love making these sub accounts online to save up for my Suns season tickets or car insurance easily. \n\nThey have a couple branches in the East Valley and even though I moved to Scottsdale, I still will keep them as my bank. \n\nProtip: They are part of the Allpoint network and you can pull money from your account with no fees at tons of places all over the valley and country. I downloaded an Allpoint app to tell me where all those ATMs are at. \n\nIn addition, they are part of a credit union network so you can deposit money at other credit unions like it was a TSCU and it will go into your account. Take that big banks!!",

    "text": "So, I've lived in Tempe all my life, needless to say, TSCU has been there for the majority of it. They have only gotten better since my first savings account started there, back when I was a wee lad. I recently had the pleasure of closing a mortgage with this bank to which I can say 'kudos' to TSCU for helping me buy my first residence. They were super helpful and laid everything out for me in easy terms. The situation was pretty atypical though-- After applying for a lender that bank sometimes uses, it dragged on, and I was very nervous I wasn't going to be able to close on the property. The loan officer I was dealing with, actually went all the way up the ladder to see if she could move the process along. Needless to say, the company they normally used, decided to be buttheads and take forever, so she talked the people in charge and was able to get everything financed in house... Booyah. Now I'm happy owner of a nice little condo. \n\nThis bank is super awesome, they've always been friendly every time I've been in there. As long as you avoid the lunch rush, I've never had to wait more than a minute or two to get to a teller inside. They have 3 drive-thru tellers, so you won't waste any gas sitting and waiting to get helped.",

Their roadside assistance service is inexpensive, top notch, and has gotten me out of more than a few jams during my times behind the wheel when things didn't always go the way I expected them to. The fact that their individual branches have installed DMV kiosks to simplify the process of car registration.\n\nUnfortunately, the guy that \"assisted\" us when I went in to register my car was the biggest asshole in the world.\n\nI went in with my mother to do the registration, we said what we were there to do, and that we knew what to do. Despite this, the guy (he was a bigger, older guy with a stereotypical East Coast accent) stood over us, watching our every move, bitching about every little thing. He bitched at me for not scanning the barcode right, for trying to put the wrong card in the machine.... you get the idea. Triple A is a \"service\" company dedicated to helping people. This guy was just a piece of shit who wanted to feel like a big shot by making other people feel stupid. \n\nAs a life-long sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome, social situations and dealing with people are twice as hard for me than so-called \"normal\" people. Jerks like this are a big part of the reason why I am the way I am today, having trouble dealing with people at places. If anyone at the AAA company is reading this, I unfortunately do not have the guy's name, but if he's still there, I would appreciate it if he was fired.\n\nStill, I don't want one bad experience to tarnish the AAA name. This is a great company that does great things, and goes the extra mile to help motorists and travels in need, and with basic services. But if this guy is still working at the GVP location, go the extra mile to a different location for your needs.",

I have waited for 3 days to have any kind of roadside service and each day for a minimum of 5 hours in 105 degree heat. I ask what I have done as a loyal paying customer to deserve such egregious treatment. I would not trust this department as far as I could throw them. When I explained to their supervisor Ron that I had been waiting for 3 hours in the heat outside he told me to wait in the lobby. To which I replied it was a resort and I had already checked out and was not allowed in the lobby. Please help me understand why you're horrible time estimations and terrible customer service is MY fault because I'm not in the lobby?! Absolutely ridiculous.

My need to actually visit the bank is rare, as I have direct deposit and seldom use cash.

My visit to the Matthews branch over the holidays was painless (MUCH less painless than the visit to Wells minutes before that) and yesterday I needed a cashier's check so I visited the Tyvola branch near my office.\n\nWhen I have visited this location, the inside always seems to be pretty busy.  But on Friday they had all 4 desks open with tellers, so the line moved along quickly.  The drive thru almost always has all 3 lanes open, so when I have had to visit the ATM, the drive thru lanes seem to move quickly as well, with a limited wait, if any.  At 37 years old, I had never had to get a cashier's check before (I am sheltered, apparently), but the young lady who helped me made the process as quick as painless as possible and didn't make me feel like a complete idiot for not knowing how to obtain a cashier's check.\n\nI have been nothing but impressed by Truliant and their customer service for as long as I have been using them and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to escape the big banks.",

    "text": "When I called based upon their website,  I had anticipated some intelligent conversation regarding the High Deductible Plan F for medicare supplement insurance. I had talked with a salesperson named  Shelly to find out the difference between plan F high deductible and regular plan F and regular plan G other than the $2180 deductible.\n\nWhen I reviewed the plans online I had thought it was a no brainer taking the high deductible as essentially your paying a 65.00 premium as opposed to 160 to 220 a month. So you're paying 1200 to 1800 a year to insure against a 2180 loss! \n\nBut Shelly had no input on that and essentially said she had not written a high deductible policy in over 3 years and had no idea what it involved now. That's very interesting considering that when I asked her for the name of someone else I might talk to in the company  she indicated that she is the \"senior\" expert for the brokerage and no one else could help me.\n\nNow I can assume the commission on the high deductible is much lower than plan f or plan G. But it's amazing to me that a person and company that puts themselves out as being helpful to seniors would act like they have never heard of plan F hi deductible.\n\nI am still astonished at their approach. Myself at this point would not even consider any plan from this company. It's a new low as far as I am concerned for insurance salespeople. \n\nMy next complaint will be to the Department of Insurance for the State of Nevada. This is a serious disservice to seniors that wish to learn all their options rather than just the ones the broker wants to present.",

Now it's true- their customer service reps at the Chase call center are like middle line backers for your account, and getting one question wrong can get you sacked. But your account is the quarterback- that is their job. Inside the branches, the representatives are always nice and super patient; thanks- my brain is like dial-up at times. I also like the new ATM's where you can withdraw cash in different denominations; not everyone is about that 20's lifestyle- I'm not here to make it rain. If that's your style though, the ATM still gives large bills. The drive-up is exceptionally fast and accurate too, I'll admit I'm a bank drive-up customer that's always in a rush, but these folks are fast, friendly and efficient- which is great!

    "text": "I have been a member of DSFCU for almost 20 years. I have no significant complaints about their customer service. They have always been friendly and helpful.... but I am about to close my main account (a checking account). \n\nI understand that banking has become incredibly competitive and it is now difficult to avoid fees at any bank or credit union unless you go all online with Ally. As DSFCU enacted new hoops to jump through to keep my checking account free, I leapt throught them because they weren't too much of an inconvenience. There haven't really been any compelling reason to stay with DSFCU for years but I did. Their online banking interface is incredibly dated. As with most credit unions, they don't have many of their own ATMs and none outside of Arizona. Yes, I know \"shared branching\" exists but it's a lot easier to find a \"Chase\" or \"Bank of America\" sign. I will admit, they finally addressed the poorly designed phone app so that was a plus.\n\nBut... when I found out about this new \"Relationship Rewards\" program, it pushed me off the edge. After being notified a month ago that all accounts were being switched over to this program, I received a detailed mailing a few days ago. It contained a welcome letter, a four page explanation of fees and a large, color fold out brochure loaded with graphics and text explaining the new \"Relationship Rewards\" system. \n\nThe letter told me I was at the \"achieve\" level. I am a college educated professional. It took me some time to figure out what factors lead to placing me there. I followed the X/Y table to determine where my row and column met. After that, I wasn't entirely clear on the parameters so I had to carefully read the fine print. I ultimately figured out that I could avoid the checking fee by either making direct deposits of $750+/month OR maintaining a balance over $2500 OR making 25 debit card transactions/month (that's ridiculous!). It would have been a lot simpler to just include those three parameters in the letter rather than solving a puzzle. \n\nOf course, there are a bunch of miscellaneous benefits of the \"achieve\" level but there's only one that really matters to most people - waiving monthly fees. I had all these benefits on my checking account before this \"Relationship Rewards\" program. Before this program, I knew the three things, the same three things mentioned above, that allowed me to avoid fees.\n\nSo, DSFCU, there really was no reason for me to stick with you and this convoluted new \"Relationship Rewards\" program makes banking with you more complicated. I'm not going to jump through this hoop.\n\nMy advice? You have become a big bank (err... I mean... credit union). You've managed to become just like a big bank but with even less convenience. I think you may sometimes have a little edge when it comes to loans and that probably helps your bottom line. I think you should rethink ways you can return to being an option to the big banks rather than becoming so much like them.\n\nNow... you still have my mortgage which is fine. I don't have to traverse a maze or solve a sudoku puzzle to determine or pay the monthly bill. Please don't screw that up.",

I live in NJ and have always requested all my bills/policies to be sent to my NJ address. Well somewhere along the line I stopped getting any mail for my Nevada policies. My husband came out to Nevada to find outdated insurance cards on a paid in full policy. Had to call a State Farm service center to have temp card emailed. Since then, I have never received any insurance cards from them. We always have to have them emailed with the promise that hard copies will follow. Only they never do. The latest debacle was finding out that our homeowner's deductible had been raised to $3441 and our auto deductible to $2000!!!!!  Needless to say we have cancelled with State Farm in Nevada. This agency is definitely not a \"good neighbor\".  I highly recommend you find a different office to handle your insurance needs.",

    "text": "I'm so happy I found Don on Yelp and interviewed him. I actually interviewed several CPA's and Don was the best by far overall. I'm the type that is willing to travel pretty far for a great tax person that knows their stuff but luckily he's conveniently located. I have since referred a handful of people all of which have used Don for their services and have been extremely satisfied with his services. If you're one of those people that do the online H&R block or those other ones, I'm telling you that you're paying for what you get and it's not good. CPA's are the only way to go as they identify things that us regular people may not know that we can deduct and more. \n\nOn your first visit he'll ask you to bring last years taxes, along with anything else that is helpful, then takes a look. I then submitted all my reports, taxes, etc to him via email he completed the we met in person to review and sign off. Overall it was the easiest and most convenient meetings that I have done and process for my taxes. He doesn't charge much and what he does charge, it's well worth the cost. Saved me over $1300 on taxes I thought I had to pay and realize I did not and now the IRS approved my amendment on prior year taxes and will be sending that money back to me. Just this year alone, he's saved me over $2K on taxes that if I used online services (which I've done in the past and never again) I would have never seen that money and would have probably owed. \n\nI will continue to use Don and I know that the people I referred to him that have used him also will continue too.",

Long story short the funds were transferred out of my account twice which was not PNCs fault.\n\nI called Paypal and they sent a letter to PNC and myself stating they had made an error, that the funds were on their way back to my PNC account and to please forgive any fees which may have been incurred.\n\nI had two overdraft fees of $36 each, two overdraft protection charges of $10 each on my credit card, and one $7 continuous charge as I awaited the funds. \n\nNone of this bothered me. \n\nA week later the fees still hadn't been return so I emailed PNC asking about the status. I received a canned response saying it could take up to two days to receive the refund IF IT IS APPROVED, meaning since there wasn't an error on their part, they felt entitled to keep my money. What a bunch of scumbags.\n\nA week later, well past the two day waiting period, I emailed again. The rep simply said there was a response to your last message that stated..... And copy pasted the previous message from them stating it would be 2 days. \n\nWhat a joke. PNC can keep the $100 because they have lost my business.",

    "text": "If I had written my review of PNC Bank five years ago when I was naive and getting my first debit account I would have given them five stars. After my experiences this past month, I am embarrassed by the fact that I remained loyal to this bank for so long.  While in the past I have not had many issues with their services, transferring money from another account into my own never proved to be simple  It was always such a long process and who has time for inconvenience these days in our high maintenance, technology driven world!! But, that's not why I'm giving them one star.\n\nWhat makes them really stand out as a one star? Their customer service.\n\nThe customer service representative I spoke to tonight was entirely unhelpful when I required her services.  I recently relocated to the Midwest from the East Coast and decided to open an account with a different bank that is actually prominent in the Midwest, WellsFargo. Therefore, I was neither making any more deposits into my PNC account nor using my PNC card.  I forgot to change the payment information for an online account I had been registered with that required a monthly payment, so when I noticed my account was overdrawn I was taken aback but then came to the realization of what had happened. The means that PNC took to inform me about my overdrawn account was through a mailed letter... which i received almost a week after my account dropped below zero. Each day after I had irresponsibly overdrawn my account, PNC charged me a fee of $7. Even though I was entirely unaware as I awaited their snail mail. In the age of technology we are in, I would expect them to at least send an email or try notifying me in any other way. This was a huge disappointment but I blamed myself for the mistake in the first place.\nThis was entirely my own fault and I immediately took action to solve the problem by paying off the amount to get my account to a balance of zero. Now all I wished to do was close out the account. The first attempt I made was \"too soon\" after I had paid off the charges from overdrawing the account.  So I let the account sit for about a week. \n\nThen I called back during their customer service representative hours to close out my account tonight. After waiting on hold to terrible elevator music and wanting nothing but to put in ear plugs for about 15 minutes, I finally received a representative, Anita. I informed Anita that I had been wanting to close out my account for awhile now due to relocating and using a different banks services. She then told me that my account was overdrawn the small amount of $8.95 so she could do nothing to help me. I explained that I was confused as to why someone had tried to cash a check from my account today for that amount since I haven't touched the account in a couple of weeks and she said I'd have to call back tomorrow if I wanted to figure anything out. She was very rude and did not give me any information. I'll admit that I don't know everything about how banking and their processing works but I could not believe that I sat waiting for a customer service representative to not give me a single piece of advice or more than five minutes of her time. When I asked her if she could note that we spoke tonight regarding my concerns, she acted defensive and rude. I am very very disappointed with the customer service I received tonight and I hope that tomorrow I will be able to rid myself of this company and my account with them for good, because I have only faced problems and poor service lately. \n\nWhew, it feels good to get that off my chest.",

They told me that they were just about the only lawyers in town that were able to do a bankruptcy OR a debt settlement OR a loan modification OR a short sale.  I didn't realize how many options were open to me.  I'm underwater on my house and felt trapped.  I don't feel trapped any more, just from knowing how many choices I have.  \n\nHere's the kicker: I talked to both lawyers for a long time, maybe 30 or 45 minutes.  I didn't sign anything, and I didn't give them any money.  I plan to, but haven't had the opportunity yet.  There was no pressure, and I feel like we parted friends.\n\nI wanted to subtract a star at first because I was on time for our appointment, but still had to wait 10 minutes.

Judah & his team--especially Kristen--worked absolutely tirelessly to resolve my case, and in just a few months my short sale was approved and both my 1st AND 2nd mortgage balances were completely forgiven!\n\nDuring this process my property also experienced severe water damage and P&A intervened to ensure that the repairs were made and that the insurance funds were properly disbursed to the contractors involved--thereby preventing the funds from being confiscated by the mortgage holder(s) who could have applied the insurance $ to my outstanding loan balance(s) without my knowledge.  ALL of this for NO additional charge!!  \n\nTo this day, I still can't believe that a \"saga\" that took nearly 3 1/2 years to resolve is FINALLY over ONLY because of P&A Law.   VERY reasonable flat-rate fee--no $urprises or retainer$--and worth EVERY penny!!  Even more so, the sense of relief and peace of mind I am now able to feel is priceless.\n\nFor all of this & more I will forever be truly grateful that I just happened to be listening to that call-in radio show one Saturday afternoon not too long ago :-)",

We purchased a home that was built in 1977 and we are doing our demolition and came across a big patch (6 ft by 6 ft) of mold on the drywall and studs in one of the rooms. Rich came and checked it out and was very thorough with his inspection. In the end, he provided his honest assessment and provided us some DIY tips to clean it up, which we absolutely appreciated. The mold isn't \"alive\" and there's no dampness, so take some bleach and water solution and wipe it down to clean it up. \nCost: $0\nGreat advice and it was truly a free consultation. \n\nThanks Rich!!",

When I arrived they wouldn't do it because it required a witness signature for my power of attorney document. I called my attorney and he said to proceed without the witness signature. I go back to MidFirst, let them know it doesn't require a witness signature and they still refused to do it. You could tell their Manager Steve was stressed out and having a bad day. He was condescending with me. I'm considering taking my banking somewhere else. BMO Harris Bank is running a special until 12-31-16 up to $500 for opening checking and savings account. Hmmm... \n\nUpdate: Steve the Manager did call to apologize after the fact, however, it didnt happen until after filing a complaint with MidFirst Corporate. Steve reluctantly apologized telling me how it takes a bigger man to apologize and that I should not feel ackward when I visit his branch. He apparently talked to his staff. I guess I didn't realize I should feel embarrassed. I just listened while Steve tried to dig himself out of the hole and politely thanked him for calling. Long short, I called MidFirst corporate back and asked that Steve no longer contact me. I've moved half of the little money I have to another bank but did ask MidFirst Corporate if they have any other MidFirst locations in my area. I suggested they contact me (not Steve) to further discuss our partnership. If I don't hear back, I think it goes without saying I will discontinue using MidFirst services. I will say the other staff members at the Ray/Cooper MidFirst branch along with their corporate office are very kind and polite. I will let you know if MFB follows up.",

I emailed him to stop harassing me and the loan is on a bk.He continues to stalk me through his friend on fb, yelp, email. His business must not be doing to well to be harassing me for $1700 . I dont do drugs and my family is beyond close to me. This guy had my grandmothers ring and threw it away. It was never pawned and he has zero paperwork saying it was. I had him hold it for me and that is it. He is the lowest from these emails and nonsense. This is why judges do not like people like him. I was warned about his gambling problem. His friends have to write his reviews. Finally a news station contacted me for a story in which I will be meeting them when I'm in vegas if he continues. I have had to put a pin on my SSN because of his character which these pictures show. If someone doesn't pay you take them to court if you have the correct papers which he never turned my title to DMV. If one has that a judge will do a judgment which isn't a big deal since I'm doing a BK. And a business owner never harasses a customer calling them names that's not ok and deformation of character as well and stealing. I'm the one that has lawsuit now. So if your a customer and thinking of going here read the emails, fb mes. (That he had to go through a friends acct) and Yelp and continues to stalk me. He will do the same to any customer. Shawn bk your on it. Get over it and stop stalking me creeper. DO NOT do business here run like forest gump. Attached are his stalking mes. You can't get away with what you Shawn have sent me. It's black and white. Your business is going to be exposed and it's your doing. Leave me alone creepy guy. No wonder I'm gay. Classy business person \"not\"",

Why don't they just take care the customer in one call.  instead of making me to chase the rainbow.  \n  After the first called, they want me to hang up and redial the number again just to get the pin.  Why can they give me the pin in one call.  Did I said the bank screw up my husband card with my SS#?  So the Systems doesn't recognize the phone number I applied to open the account with or the SS#.  Since the bank already mess up the account, why can the systems recognize the information.  \nI called the 866 numbers at lease 5 times trying to setup my account but failed.  Ever time I called, I have to repeat my husband card numbers,  the DOB, SS#, address over and over again for at lease more than 5 times just to setup for pin number and still didn't get my pin number due to the systems can't recognize the information.  I was wonder who screw up my account in the first place.  HELLOOOOOO....  I just want to activate my card and get the pin number.  that is call.  WHY make it so hard for the customer to go around and around. I have not try my card yet.  It is just my husband card I am trying to setup....

On 12/1 @ 9:48 am AND 1:32 pm, I called Nariaza and left a message and no response.  On 12/2 @10:11 am I called Nariaza and left a message and no response.  Not one courtesy call back!

Today is 12/14 and still no check. This continues to be a vicious and frustrating experience.\n\n I was offered a $50 gift card by Nariaza to write a YELP review...probably sure this was not what she was expecting...but $50 does not give me back all the lost time I spent trying to get ahold of her.

They've made me close down my accts in between my moving from TX to CA to NV which in my opinion defeats the purpose of it being Bank of \"AMERICA\". It should just be Bank of \"this state\" and that be the end of it. But for some reason the state of CA wants to be difficult and go off an entirely different system and be b/c they didn't want me to trouble themselves by helping me start an IRA with my retirement fund from my previous employer they wanted me to just cash the check and pay the taxes on that $. No.\n\nNow this branch is the one I go to mostly here in Henderson. They have friendly staff - completely opposite of most of the BOA's I had to deal with in San Diego (which I cant understand how they kept most of those people employed as rude and unhelpful as they are - espec. in Carlsbad.) But every time I go in they help me and are very nice about it. The blond lady with the clipboard (not familiar with her name) but she seems genuine.

We walked into the brand new Decatur branch and met with Dawn Young. From day 1 consulting us for which loan that best suits our needs, to the day we received the loan, the experience with her has been impeccable! Even though when you go through a loan you have to go through your records and gather (what it seems) an ever so long list of things in order to be approved, she answered ever question, email, & telephone call and explained everything we needed to know in full detail! We were never confused about anything that was before us. Although along the way, I think it was the processor, Chianti? That we had to deal with, was a little speed bump in the process as some of her phone conversations and emails were very short and we were confused after we hung up the phone with her. I immediately contacted Dawn and she apologized and handled everything for us. We skipped emailing back the processor and just dealt with Dawn as it was much easier that way. I just wanted to point out an amazing employee who truly cares about her members! For any loan needs .....please go see Dawn at the Decatur branch.....You will be treated like Royalty!! My husband I are thoroughly please and would recommend CCCU  & Dawn for any home loan needs!!",

    "text": "We needed to acquire health insurance on our own (as in, not through an employer). It's crazy trying to wade through all of the choices that are available. Trish C at Nevada Benefits knows all of the companies, their different plans and types of coverage - takes time to listen to your individual situation and then helps you choose which type of coverage and plan is right for you. \n\nI first met Trish in August 2013 when our COBRA medical coverage was ending from Tim's previous job. She was super nice and patient, explained everything very clearly and really helped us sort out our options. We decided that a short-term \"catastrophic\"  type of policy would cover us for six months until either our job situation changed or until the new government insurance plans kicked in. The six month policy, instead of a long-term policy with all of its hoops to jump through, saved us thousands of dollars in premiums and a ton of time in medical questionnaires and the qualification process. The best thing is, we didn't use the insurance the whole six months. We were covered if something major happened and were prepared to cover the expenses if it was something minor - but nothing medical ever happened - nothing at all ! It was a roll of the dice that we wouldn't encounter minor medical issues or a broken bone or something in these six months but it worked out really well. \n \nNow more recently, with Tim still being an independent contract employee and not being under the umbrella of a company that provides health insurance, Trish has again helped sort out the differences between companies and plans (and different levels of coverage in the different plans!)  I had a ton of random and specific questions and she always responded quickly to emails and phone calls - would email me different breakdowns in plans, along with the prices -listened to me talk about the differences and steered me in the direction that was right for us based on what level of risk we felt comfortable in taking. She treated me so nicely and was even more patient than the first time - is professional and yet would joke around with me at the same time. Now we have a health insurance plan that will work out for us until a change in job situation - it's good for peace of mind for sure. The plan we chose is definitely way more expensive than the short-term plan (and some of the long-term plans !) but it looks to be something that will cover us and protect us not just for emergencies or major major things, but for minor and even preventive care/screenings as well. \n\nWithout insurance coverage provided by a job, the cost is all ours. It would be really tempting to try to live with more minimal health insurance - but with no crystal ball to know what will happen in the future, there's no way we can do this. It's a real maze if you've always had coverage from work and then suddenly you choose to go out on your own. USE THIS COMPANY ! Trish and the rest of the Nevada Benefits staff are very friendly, easy to talk with, very experienced and confident and really enjoy what they do. . . and it really comes across in the way they interact. It has been so great working with them.",

    "text": "For those who don't know the principle of Tangerine, it's a bank without any brick-and-mortar branches; they claim to offer an alternative to traditional banking with their online services. To compensate the fact that they don't have any branches, they offer phone customer service 7 days a week 24 hours a day + online chat sessions. If you really want to talk with a real human in front of you, they have this \"Caf\u00e9 Tangerine\" where you can talk to Tangerine employees. Cool concept! \n\nPros: \nGiven that their only physical presence is the caf\u00e9 Tangerine, they do a huuuuge amount of savings on rent expenses; that makes them able to give A LOT of services for free that the other banks can not afford: for example, a free checking account with unlimited transactions, for everyone!! They even give money for free: when you refer a friend, both of you win a 50$ reward in your account (sometimes it's only 25$). Now let's talk about their online banking: it's ok. There are very useful features with their mobile app, such as the one that allows you to deposit your cheques with just a picture of the front and the back of the cheque. Other banks do that too, so nothing exceptional, it's the same as the online service I have with RBC, but still pretty useful and it works very well. \n\nCons: I guess they had to pay a price for all the savings they do with their no-branch system, and the price to pay is definitely a lot of problems with their customer service. \nThe chat simply doesn't work. EVERYTIME I tried to chat with somebody it says: \"All of our chat team Associates for Saving and Chequing are online with other Clients right now. Please try starting another chat session later.\", and it's not me in particular, I saw the same comments about the chat service in a lot of other reviews. \nTheir phone service:  terribly long wait time, always. \nRegarding the 50$ awards when I refer a friend, yes it does work, and I made 150$ referring 3 friends; BUT I always had to run after them to have the reward, which means waiting forever on the phone to talk to somebody. \nFor me as a young student who has a lot of free time it's not a big deal, but for dynamic professionals, I guess they have other things to do than running after 50$ rewards and that they would rather pay fees and have a good service. \n\nRegarding the service at their Caf\u00e9, I went once and it was ok. It was fast to deposit a cheque, but for more complex questions, they just connected me to the phone help.  They were very friendly, simple, less boot-licker than RBC (lol). It was very relaxing to sit and have a coffee there.\n\nOverall : the Cafe is a cool concept, and it's a good bank if you only want to do online transactions and save a lot on banking fees. I use my Tangerine checking account to manage a family budget, so 99% of the operations are just online transactions to other accounts; in that point of view, I am totally satisfied with Tangerine, but I would never use it for day-to-day banking.",

I was expecting a smooth process both based on my friend's experience and my history with loans. I am 840 credit, annual income better than the property value, and 25% down.  \n\nJohn Edwards was not helpful and tried to charge in excess of 8k in fees on a real estate lot loan that I would have less than 6 months!! It would have been cheaper and less painful to get a loan from a loan shark. A week after expressing discontent at the insane costs (and my decision to pay cash for the property) an appraisal was apparently ordered and $325 was demanded.  \n\nJohn insisted that I had agreed to the appraisal (signed in my packet) so I asked for copies of authorization of the appraisal and was refused multiple times. I asked if I would be able to use the appraisal for a future construction loan and he refused to even answer that question... It was a silly interaction and very unprofessional on his side. To top it off, apparently asking for copies of my authorization made him mad because just 4 days after being notified of the payment for appraisal, he gave me 4.5 hours to pay it or take me to collections. \n\nThis is a company/person at the top of the avoid at all costs list!  Despite many emails back and forth, John continues to refuse to provide a copy of this document. Ironically had he told me he had ordered it without me authorizing in order to expedite I would have felt compelled to pay for it. Had it applied to a future loan, that would have been a bonus. At this point I believe he has outright lied about it and threatened me (all communication via email, and have to provide to anyone wanting) not only with collections, but also with a threat to share personal information \"when my business(es) come up in conversation\".  I never attacked this man, and kept all interaction professional whereas he has resorted to name calling and threats...\n\nI'm shocked at his insane responses and would encourage any and all to steer clear (and definitely not provide and personal information).\n\n(I will update this should any more action happen/take place).

    "text": "A follow up to my previous post: Two things have happened since our exit as customers of Wells Fargo. 1.) We still get emails asking us to do our banking online. Thete is no \"unsubscribe\" and no way to opt out of communications, and 2.) We were victims of the recently exposed Wells Fargo employees scam to open phony accounts, debit cards and credit cards. At the time of each occurence, a Wells Fargo \"banker\"explained it was a security plan by the bank to open shadow accounts (their words, not mine) for customers. Now we know at least 5300 employees have been terminated and Wells Fargo paid a near $190,000,000 fine in California.\n\nAfter more than 20 years being a Wells Fargo customer... checking and savings accounts, CDs, mortgage loans and line of credit, business accounts, ...used a lot of their services, including domestic and international wire transfers. During the last 10 years or so, the personnel at the three branches I used (Anthem Center, Hampton Road and Bicentennial) have become less knowledgeable and much less willing to be helpful. In fact, what has prompted this review is yet another mistake and lack of good judgement. This one cost me time and money to fix not to mention the stress it created for me. The \"banker's lack of concern and treating me like I am an idiot was the proverbial LAST STRAW. No one at Wells Fargo will care that I am gone along with my accounts, but acquiring a customer to take my place isn't cheap.  It felt good to walk out of Wells Fargo today knowing I would never have to go there again.",

    "text": "One Of the worst pawn shops I have ever dealt with. These guys are so cheap and so rude. They are very stand offish and could care less of what your going thru. People obviously go to a pawn shop when you are in desperate need of some fast cash. These people low balled me on very everything I had. I had an item that was still pretty much brand new, only two weeks old. Retail it was $179.99. He looked his stuff up on eBay he worst site to go off of, and out of all the listings he picked the lowest one out of all of them. Out of 100 listings 95 of them were selling for $100-$115 and he picked a listing selling for $50. Only offered me $25 for my $179 item. Such garbage stay far away from this place. Please trust me on this. Ridiculous.",

    "text": "This pawn shop has a security gate and sometimes some seedy looking folks trying to sell something stolen. The products available for purchase are televisions, computers, laptops, dvd players, stereos, game consoles, dvds, blu-ray discs, a few musical instruments, gold, guns, and tools. \n\nI suppose I just described just about every pawn shop. The prices here suck. I imagine the buy prices are terrible. The people that run the place I wouldn't trust to park my car - or stand behind me in line at the bank for that matter. Actually it kinda makes me uncomfortable that they are right down the street from me. \n\nDid I mention this place has guns? So many guns. If you need to kill something, they have shotguns, knives and handguns and I think I even saw a crossbow. It's actually an interesting visit wandering around the tiny shop. They have a few nice things... the prices are damn near retail prices on items that haven't been a retail item for a few years - for example, they sell a 3 year old desktop that cost 499 new for 399. Just keep your money in your pocket (and your hand in there as well to protect it) and you'll be fine. \n\n__\n\nThis review was from April of 2008 - that's over 6 years ago now. I just wanted to point out to the reviewer who referred to my review that it's possible the place fell under new ownership since then or changed out some of the items inside as it had been several years since my experience. Also, I find it amusing that the other review says they are as good as it gets and then gives them one star more than I did. If I had the experience described, I would have given 5 stars. Great service? Discounts? Exactly what you wanted? 3 stars. Yelp is weird, man.",

As soon as you press the button to get in (if the building is locked), they will respond on the intercom and a person will come out to greet you and open the door for you. Then they also direct you to the right elevators. Overall, I find the building easy to access and the employees in there nice and helpful and the view from the 20th floor relaxing.

We ended up setting our homeowners, auto, and life insurance with Jeff and D; One stop shop for all your insurance needs. By having all our insurance fulfilled by Jeff and D (Farmers Insurance), it is more convenient handling all insurance business related matters and we get the most effective discount. Service is top notch! Service is very personal and very individualizing. Not everyone can fit in the same cookie cutter product. With Jeff and D, they listen carefully to your needs.  Afterwards, they do what they do best in the business which to find the product that meets your criteria.  Think of them as your tailors for your insurance. With the services they provide, one would think one would have to pay more...think again. I, personally, saved at least $1,000 a year average by using their services with my home, auto, and life combined when compared to my previous multiple insurance carriers. They have an excellent business model. They grow their business by earning your business for life.  Once you switch over with them, your expectations from your insurance carrier customer service skyrockets. NO other business can compare; they set the bar sky-high. Anytime I have a question or I need something, they are always there to take care of us. It's like talking to your friend not a 1-800 multiple redirects. In fact, you get so personal that I wouldn't be surprise that not only that you would have an insurance agent for life; you will also have a friend for life.

Much thanks to Francisco, Kris, and Sonja for pooling their knowledge to answer all of my questions and help me make the decision that will best benefit me in the future.\n\nI graduated a little over a year ago and had a TON of questions about general financing for... life! With little to no knowledge of what I should be doing with my money, I scheduled a meeting with Francisco to cover all of this. I was nervous he would get annoyed with so many questions, but he was very patient, understandable and friendly! We pulled in Kris and Sonja to help with a few things and they were equally pleasurable. In addition to answering my questions, they let me know about other related services I can take advantage of in the future. It makes me so happy to know that they care about helping me, and understand that money can be stressful. Wells Fargo is the best. \n\nEvery time I walk into this branch, someone is eager to help with whatever--from a simple deposit to financial planning for life. They understand that money can be unnerving and confusing, and they will put in their time to make sure you leave better off than when you arrived. That being said, some of these processes can take time (I was in the office for about an hour and a half) but you will be so happy you took that time to cover everything. I am so happy with what we got done during my visit Saturday, and I'm looking forward to returning to talk about other future financial ventures!",

When multiple people asked why there were no tellers the greeter told us everyone was on their lunch. I don't understand why they need a greeter when they could have had 2 tellers. Someone had over 10 cash deposits and they still kept her as the only teller. One person in the back of the line made a scene and said she was going to leave her money and leave the bank. She actually got pulled to the front of the line and was helped. She might have been there 15 minutes total. I guess the moral of the story is make a huge scene so they take care of you? What makes it worse is their greeter/customer service persons attitude. She deflected every single complaint instead of being apologetic about the wait she was going into how many required hours they have and talking about labor laws. Zero customer service.

I walk in with a check written from my partner's Money Market Account from his broker. Now maybe there are a lot of deadbeats out there that walk around writing bad checks from their brokers account, but I'm not one of them. \n\nI so long for my local bank back in Chicago that called me by name, allowed me to cash checks without ID and were generally much friendlier. \n\nAt Wells Fargo they ALWAYS ask \"How are you today?\" Like they really freakin care. No they were brainwashed to ask that. And then when you have a deposit over $2,000 they give you the third degree and have to call for teller assistance. Why not just train the tellers in the first place how to do their jobs? By all means don't take any large deposits to the grocery store branches they'll never be able to help you out. I think it's the training ground before you go to a real branch.\n\nWells Fargo = banking Wal-Mart style. NO - THANK - YOU!",

I have a business account here that has myself and my 2 other business partners on it. The only interaction I ever really need to have is depositing rent checks- that's it. It should be so simple, but for some reason it NEVER is! Whether I drive up or walk in, it is by far the longest deposit process of any bank I have ever been to. For reals, it takes me about 5-7 minutes (yes I have timed it) once I am at the teller window. \n\nSo today, I walk in and hand over my check and my slip. After a looooong pause (and way more typing than I believe is required to process my deposit) she asks me to confirm my home address, NOT the business address on the account. I do it, realizing later that I just confirmed some marketing departments opportunity to flood me with crap mail. Then she asks me to confirm my name... yes my name. I do it. She then asks me to sign the check right below where I have clearly written \"For Deposit Only\" and the account number. I do it. Looooooooong pause........ more typing. \n\n\"You're all set, have a great day, sorry I stole 7 minutes of your life\" (I added that last part). \n\nWells Fargo, I am NOT your fan! Peace out!",

I tend to lean towards writing positive reviews for those establishments that are epic.\n\nThis time, I just had to write this.  I learned more in five minutes inside this \"credit union\" than I thought possible.\n\nI have just moved down the street from this business.  As I was out shopping, I figured I would stop by and use the ATM and then look into this credit union.  Having done that and paid the $4 transaction fee, I walked up to a teller.  It should be noted that from the ATM to the teller (about 30 feet) I watched a supervisor/manager scolding an employee publicly.  Everyone could hear it.  \n\nBack to the teller.  As I approached, she asked what she could help me with.  I asked her to exchange some bills from the ATM for a couple of larger ones and was starting to ask her about an account, but she literally cut me off with \"do you have an account?\" to which I replied \"no, not yet\" and she matter of factly stated that she could not help me and that I would need to get my business done elsewhere.  She was extremely rude.  The lunacy of my having just taken money out of their ATM and there refusal to exchange a few bills for a larger denomination baffles me, but it was truly her attitude that cemented my decision to leave.  She even went on to say that maybe I should take my business to Wells Fargo.  I was stunned.\n\nBetween her and the manager yelling at the other employee, it was easy for me to see that this was DEFINITELY not a place I wanted to be associated with and I stated that I definitely would not open an account and left.\n\nIf this is what an ordinary customer sees in 5 minutes inside this place, it is apparent that this credit union is very broken and you may be better with your financial needs elsewhere.\n\n'nuf said.",

I just spent the afternoon with her and her FABULOUS assistant Judy reviewing all of my insurance and making sure I had enough coverage for me and my daughter.  The passion these ladies have on educating you on insurance is amazing.  Lynn also sits down with each teenage driver before they become insured and goes through an AMAZING presentation showing them how their insurance goes up if they get a ticket, or a DUI.  You can tell she is an agent who goes above and beyond.  I really enjoy working with Lynn and her team, they work very hard and out of integrity.  That is hard to find in the insurance world now adays.  Go TEAM HENNESSY!",

I had to go into the lobby and use the ATM inside the branch where I was greeted by a line of 10 people who like me, could only access their funds through an ATM.  I waited over 15 minutes to make a 30 second withdrawal.\n\nSomeone from the bank walked out to tell us that they could assist us inside the bank (like I didn't know that was an option) but since I and the rest of the people waiting don't have an actual account with the bank, we had to wait in line for the ATM.   \n\nI understand that ATMs need to be serviced but come on.  The sad part is after it took 20 min to get my cash, the Loomis Fargo guys still hadn't finished servicing them.  Total waste of time.",

It was in 2011.  She hugged me & I feel like the employees here are like family since then.  Unfortunately, she is no longer at this location.  However, everyone here is like that still.\n\nEdgar offered us water when we walked in.  The drive-up teller didn't have any cars coming thru so she came over to help the tellers.  Phil came in from his short break & offered us a water again on the way out.  \n\nCindy the manager was behind the tellers greeting everyone in line & as you walk up to the teller.  If the line is long, everyone pulls together w/ a smile on their face to quickly help.  \n\nThe only negative is the parking lot.  No big deal when you get exceptional customer service that is sometimes tough to find.  Thank you St. Rose Wells Fargo!",

    "text": "I am a recent convert to Silver State School Credit Union.  I switched to SSSCU when I got married a couple of years ago because my husband had been a member for a long time and liked them more than my bank.  My last bank was such a headache with everything and anything you would need from a bank, so I was ready for a change! Luckily I married a SSSCU member!\n\nI have been slowly closing out my other accounts and moving my stuff to SSSCU because of the great customer service.  I decided to switch over because this bank was so much better than the one I was with before hand.  This bank has just been so helpful, great with customer service, and it offers good rates, especially for a local credit union.  \n\nNow speaking of this branch specifically...Such a great location!  The most important part of the branch is that it is a regular store front with an outside ATM available 24/7.  Many of SSSCUs are located within grocery stores.  Normally this isn't a big deal, but I have a small baby and getting her in and out of the car just to go to the bank is a pain in the butt, especially since she usually falls asleep in the car ride over.  And remember, you never wake up a sleeping baby, if you don't have too!  Having a stand alone location with an ATM in front means I can get the quick ATM run done without having to get the baby out of the car.\n\nThis location also has a branch available for when you need to speak with someone personally.  It seems to be a secret because when I have gone inside, there is rarely a line and if there is one, it may be 1 person ahead of me.  What a blast it is to be in and out without having to waste an hour just waiting in line.\n\nThe people at SSSCU are also quite lovely.  Everyone is happy and nice.  It is also a pleasure to walk in because everyone smiles at you if you catch their eye.  No grumps here!  I hope it always stays that way.\n\nSo if you need a new bank and can qualify for SSSCU, go sign up because I bet they are nicer than your bank is currently.",

My experience with this office on sunset and green valley parkway was the complete opposite. It was awful and I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy. My agent never discussed prices up front so I assumed it would be the same reasonable price from the year prior- wrong! He did my taxes which took an extremely long time. I asked questions about future filing and write offs and he didn't have many answers. Which was frustrating, but not nearly as frustrating as his attitude towards the end. When he told me it would be well over $200 I was shocked considering I had very basic tax documents, and when I asked for clarification I got an \"it is what it is\" kind of response. He had the nerve to say I didn't have the option of paying later which I questioned and he suddenly didn't bring it up again. I stated I should have gone to a CPA I know who already told me he would charged me less. The agent had the audacity to both ague with me about how much the CPA would have charged and also ask me why I even bothered coming back this year if the CPA was going to charge less! Well, had I known it was going to cost over $200 I would have gone to him. I didn't pay half that last year so I figured h&r would be the same way. He was very rude and argumentative. He even said in a snarky manner I should bring all my paperwork to my CPA and see what he has to say about it all. When I called the manager, Jennifer, she stated she would talk to him and look into it. Hours later she called back to let me know they would send me a discount for the future. Ha! She did absolutely nothing about my experience there. Rather than trying to do anything she simply gave an insincere apology and stated she couldn't do anything. Awful customer service. Oh and did I mention that the receptionists are 3 catty women who talk about the drama and their clients from the day before? Don't expect your visit to stay confidential. Better yet, go elsewhere and make sure your expectations are met and that you aren't scammed. \n\n***h&r sent me a survey to fill out and gave me the option to share my thoughts online but when I attempted to post this and rate it a 0 and stated I wouldn't go back, it suddenly wouldn't let me post... Hmmm the irony. Imagine how many people have bad experiences that they're trying to cover up.",

Instead of filling out a deposit slip with the cash and simply giving it to a teller there are now several inconvenient steps involved. First, you need to dial up a virtual teller that tries to have a convo with you. Next, you have to put the 20's that their atm only spits out into the slot. No 100's. The machine only allows up $1000 deposit. My rent is $1150 so i had to wait for the guy to process 1 deposit before doing the next. Also since my rent is $150 more and all i have are $20's, i put in 160 and he tells me that i cant get $10 back change over the machine. So, now my landlord gets an extra $10 for me putting in the leg work. \n\nOn top of all of this i could barely hear my teller because the next machine is 2 feet behind me and the volume was at max.\n\nThis is a failed attempt at being innovative and i wont be back to this branch and may even cancel my account just for creating such a ridiculous process.",

    "text": "what a joke, just go to the DMV or, even easier, myDMV online, or any kiosk at a grocery store or AAA location (both within 1.5 miles of this outfit). all are less of a hassle than these condescending scammers. in their defense, they're only preying on the lazy and uninformed in this city, so there's that. I've utilized DMV drop/registration services before, all pretty cut and dry: pay a convenience fee for them to go to the DMV for you, get your tags in the mail a week or so later. NOT ONCE have I not received DMV correspondence in the mail, yet somehow it happens to this place \"all the time\". counter guy's words, not mine.\nso, after I pay my registration and convenience fees to DMV Drop, I'm told my tags will come in the mail 7-10 days later. of course, I can pay a higher \"convenience\" fee to be able to come back to pick up my tags same day (kinda ironic how inconvenient that is, right?). obviously no need to do that since I've always received DMV mail.\nwell, a month later (went on vacay for a couple weeks), no tags. now I hafta go back to this place (inconvenient) and listen to this clown veil his condescending tone with niceties, like we some kind of homies, making it sound like he's doing me a FAVOR to not charge me another $50 appointment fee to go back to the DMV. uh, ok.\nALL I have to do is run around town (inconvenient), pay to get forms notarized (inconvenient), and pay for the duplicate tag form's service fee (inconvenient).\nyes, these are minimal amounts, and yes, I have since done my research and taken care of this debacle on my own (no notary, no running around town, tags in hand) without any more \"assistance\" from DMV Drop. not the point. my novel here on Yelp is meant to warn of the BS business practices of this particular DMV registration service, and urge fellow motorists in Vegas to overcome our laziness and get informed. businesses and people like DMV Drop are everywhere in this city, just waiting for the opportunity to take advantage of people. do your homework and be self-reliant. and DO NOT GIVE DMV DROP YOUR BUSINESS.",

But they did get me the plates/registration processed ... fast. Then why 3 stars? Well, these folks, as nice as they are, don't seem to know the most basic things about the DMV services. 1) Could not tell me if I needed the smog check. (I chose not to do it and was correct.) 2) I was getting special plates done and they could not figure out how to arrange 6 letters. (Told me that there would be an automatic dot between the groups of three letters. Wrong, the plates came with no dot or anything ... just three letters then space then three letters.) 3) They forgot to include my apartment number on the registration. (I had to change it myself at the DMV while I was getting the DL.) 4) They are pricey. (They do not show you the price breakdown ... so it's hard to figure out where their fees end and the DMV fees begin.) 5) After I lost my decal (my fault), I called these guys for advice. They offered to \"fix\" things for $50 bucks and told me that I would need a notarized letter to get a new decal. Wrong. I called the DMV and was directed to the nearest kiosk less than a mile from my house. Got a new tag/decal for under $10 in 5 minutes. By the way, DMV is not that bad. The old days of waiting for hours and rude workers ... those days are gone! Today's DMV is nice, efficient, and computerized. Do your pocket a favor and skip Drop, Smog or whatever and go straight to the nearest DMV. I will .... next time around.",

Don't expect him or anyone in his office to advocate for you, though.    I would tell anyone to not work with this agent, and not with State Farm.

I get there and there is no Cigna center; apparently, there is another address 1920 Baseline rd in Tempe... Now, I drive all the way to Tempe from Mesa. Still get there by my appointment time, but by the time I walk in and wait behind a guy who is arguing about his billing, it's now 6 minutes past.  Guess what - they tell me \"you're late and the nurse will not see you\"....... I actually giggled, I honestly thought the lady was joking (especially after I just told her what I went through and how the address given to me by the Cigna Center employee was in the wrong location). Nope, she wasn't kidding. She told me I had to reschedule, that they couldn't see me today. Here I am: drove from Chandler to Mesa, then Mesa to Tempe and back home to Chanlder.... And then, I thought, let me call The Chandler location, I know they will make this right. Nope, I called and they told me they don't have anything until late October.... So, I'm gonna enter this same review under all Cigna Centers, because they all suck pretty bad....",

If you are on Cigna HMO then I think you have no choice but to go to one of these clinics but if you have the PPO then just find a general practitioner at a nice private practice somewhere.\n\nThe waiting room is always a total zoo and the place is so big with so many people you just don't know what you are being exposed to.  The office staff range from inept to competant but rude.  The doctors that I saw were OK but you get a different one every time so there is no chance of building a rapport.  The whole experience really makes you feel dehumanized, like you are being treated as a number not a person.  I know some of that is just the state of healthcare in this country but there are far better options out there.",

This company is not worth paying for to work, because at the start, they seem to be very professional and answer all your questions. However, as time progresses and you pay the fee that they want, they start to ignore you for \"bigger\" customers and \"more important projects.\" They, or more specifically again, Mr. Tibbets, get rude with you if you ask too many questions or want to clarify things about the taxes. They don't care for you, and they only want your money because they ask for more money if you don't understand and want more answers. That is a terrible thing to do, and I would definitely NOT EVER recommend this company to anymore. This company is probably decent, however Mr. Tibbets is definitely not someone you want to work with. Terrible. Waste of money, time and effort. Better try your luck elsewhere if you must deal with this man.",

    "text": "KeatsConnelly did my taxes last year and at first they seemed very helpful and very responsive to emails, etc.  Then they said the taxes would be done at a certain date, then the date comes and goes, I email and am told next Friday they would be done.  This goes on for two months.  I finally talk to the CEO and is very nice and assures me the taxes will get mailed to me.  Another two weeks, eventually I receive my taxes and I want an explanation for the charges that I will billed.  It seemed excessive and I wanted a break down of the hours that it took to do my taxes.  The CEO then tells me that they have been nice to me, but now they will have to start charging me for the time on the phone and the emails!  I was never given a breakdown of the time it took to do my taxes.  \n\nI now had my taxes reviewed by another tax preparation service and they said none of my itemized deductions were taken off on my taxes.  Oh, and last year was the first time I ever had to pay taxes.  So I was not surprised that my taxes were done incorrectly so now I will pay another tax service to re-do my taxes for last year so that I can get the refund that I should have originally received.  \n\nWould not recommend KeatsConnelly!!!!!  Horrible customer service!",
